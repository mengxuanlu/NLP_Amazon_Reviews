If that were the entirety of the story, this would be a 5 star review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most important part of this watch, the functionality, has some issues. Despite this being an automatic winding watch, it doesn't always stay wound. I have had days where I had to re-wind it before the end of the day. Most days however, it does last through the day. I just have to wind it and set the time again in the morning. Other mechanical self winding watches I own will in fact not need to be wound again until I stop wearing them for a full day. In addition, I can't always get the spring fully wound before it will start clicking and the spring skips off the winding gear.<br /><br />If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have returned this watch. Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window. So now I'm stuck with an only mostly working but beautiful watch. I guess that makes it kinda like a fashion model.

The manual covers several watches so it is a somewhat confusing as it refers to self-winding watches as well as quartz watches like this one.  The third page in the manual can be used as a guide to the watch adjustment method.  I found the controls to be simple, everything is controlled by the position of the crown. It can be pulled out into two position, the first position allows change the day of the month, the second position moves the arms.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.

It works well in both casual and more formal dress situations, the blue face looks fantastic, the movement is high quality and the price is pretty much unbeatable. You really do get a lot of watch for your money. You can usually find Orient watches discounted throughout the web, so if you pay more than $150 for this watch, you've probably overpaid.

They can pull the little hairs on your wrist occasionally. So a higher quality band might be something to look in to, although, despite the occasional pull, I've stuck with the OEM band for these 3 years and felt fine with it.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great looking and high-quality watch that, like all Orients, is a phenomenal deal.

Sadly, when I went to adjust the date because it was off from having a shorter month, I found out this part of the watch was broken. I do not wear it often and am not rough on it (primarily worn in an office setting). The band and watch face still look close to new, so I'm assuming the dial was broken when I received it and I realized it too late to return it. This is the third time this has happened to me when ordering a watch through Amazon. I absolutely love Kate Spade designs and they are generally of a superior quality, but when ordering on Amazon, you typically get a product that looks or functions like an item that was rejected by the maker because of minor dysfunctions. The gold-on-gold color make the watch slightly harder to read and the date dial is quite small, but the pink hands really help with visibility. The leather on this strap is very thick, which takes some adjusting to if you are used to wearing lower-profile watches. It is also a light enough color that if you are wearing it to work and are rubbing up against printed materials, the band will get a slight discoloration from the ink. The watch face is large, as other reviews suggest. I have a medium sized wrist (~ 16 cm), but it does not look too large on my wrist.

I sent it back and they sent me a new one (I had to pay for shipping and wait a couple weeks).  About 3 months later the exact same thing begins to happen...stop periodically and start back for a few hours.  Rather than send it back to wait several weeks and pay shipping again, I took it to a watch repair shop thinking maybe it's a bad battery connection but I find out that it is a faulty mechanism and required a new one.  My watch repairman orders a new mechanism from Luminox and installs it for about $65. Here we are at about 10 months later (owned the watch for a total of about 15 months) and I look down at the watch and the second hand has fallen off and is shaking around loose under the crystal.

The two tone double lock metal strap is gorgeous. It has polished center links with brushed finish links on either side. I had to remove 3 links to fit well on my wrist. There are 5 more links that can be removed to fit ones wrist (so a total of 8 links can be removed to fit ones needs). Hope this gives you an idea of the range of wrist sizes this can fit. I love the big Yellow stop watch arm. All are screw in buttons and knobs, what I mean by that is, you have to unscrew the rings by the two buttons at the top and bottom and the ring at the center knob to make it work. Once you are done using the knob and the buttons make sure to screw back the rings tight, this I suppose makes it water tight. The small dial on the left is your seconds dial, the one at the bottom is your alarm and the one at the top is your stop watch dial. Surprisingly all of the arms fall right on the marker lines when they work, may be I got lucky or may be the quality of the product is that good...I don't know! The hour/minute arms and the main dial has fluorescence on them to aid in visibility in dark surroundings. I have owned this for little over 2 weeks now!

Duct tape works ok to keep it together but I needed something that looks good on my wrist.<br /><br />I went to Target looking for a new band and I decided that for a few dollars more I could just buy a new watch and use the old one for yard work and working out.<br /><br />This model met all my requirements. I wanted a clean easy-to-read design with date and day, a comfortable brown leather band and a face that lights up clearly in the dark. So far after a few weeks I have been very happy. It looks as good as my $150 Seiko at a fraction of the price as well as keeps good time. It's still accurate to the second since I first set it.<br /><br />I am a medium to large man who normally can only get the last notch buckled in most watch bands. This band will buckle to the second notch. The advantage of leather is that it CAN stretch, so don't worry if you have large wrists. A few minutes soaking the band in water will let it custom fit even the largest of wrists.<br /><br />Design wise this watch has a nice clean legible design. I'm not going SCUBA diving or orienteering in the woods. I just want a nice stylish watch that will tell the time accurately at a glance without the distraction of nonsensical mini dials. The smaller case still looks good on my larger than normal wrist and doesn't catch on doorways or sleeves like a large bulky case would.<br /><br />I've always had good luck with Timex watches since I was a kid.

Cannot figure out how to hack the watch to synchronize the time, despite the user's manual.  The time is hard to tell, one has to search for the hour hand of the watch, because the three dials are mostly black or dark, same as most of the hour hand.  Worst of all the big red 60 second counter hand which jumps perhaps every second, does not line up with the 60 hash marks on the dial, but only about half the time.  Guessing, either the 60 second counter hand jumps at different intervals and they are not equal, or the hashmarks on the dial are not spaced equally. After nearly 162 years of watch making, a manufacturer should be able to divide the circle to 360 equal spaces and also should be able to make a second hand jump exactly 1/60th minute, every second. Operating the watch is NOT intuitive, the three time measuring dials are impossible to zero once.  The watch measures, stops, as if has its own mind, one may need a six month course to learn how to operate it.

First, like others have mentioned, the metal band squeaked a lot when I first got it -- it was very annoying to constantly have a squeaking noise coming from my wrist when I moved.  I was able to silence the noise with a few shots of silicone lubricant.  Second, the watch does not keep time very accurately, even when I wear it every day, sometimes winding it if I have had it off for more than a few hours.  In my case, the watch gains a few minutes every few days.  Third, despite the beauty of the watch in the photo, in reality it is very hard to see the silver hands against the silver background -- just glancing at it to see the time isn't possible; you have to look at it for several seconds to distinguish where the hands are, and which hand is which; I hate wearing it in low light, and often I only choose it wear it (as opposed to my other watch) if I'm going to be outside where I can see the face better.  Finally, and most annoying, the crystal somehow became chipped under normal wearing conditions a couple of weeks ago, and now it has moisture in it.  In all my life of wearing watches, I've never had a crystal chip; and I know I didn't do anything outside of normal use.  So now, because the crystal isn't covered under warranty, it's going to cost $45 for repair.  I've had a lot of watches in the same price-point as this watch during my life, but never one of such poor quality.  I won't be buying a Relic watch again.\",\n",

I was hoping not to have the replace the battery every year as needed by my previous Seiko watch and have to deal with the poor watch sealing after battery replacements. I was wrong.  The battery in my Fossil watch died within a year.  I took it back to Macy but they refused to fix it because I've misplaced my receipt and Macy could not find the  online receipt either. I ended up taking it to a jewel store for battery replacement.  It worked for approx a week after the battery replacement but died again, probably due to the poor sealing of the watch by the jeweler.  I did not want to spend the extra money to send it back to Fossil for repair either.  I did some checking and decided to try this Seiko solar watch since the solar Seiko watch i've bought for my husband several years ago still work. So far it has been working great.  The face and numbers are large enough to read and the red second-hand allows me to count heart and respiration rates incrementally well.  I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 because the date and the day of the week displayed on the watch do not always match and will take some time to get them to display right. I am happy with my new Seiko solar watch.\",\n",

              " \"Have had this watch for one week and am very pleased with it so far.  It is my first automatic watch and is more accurate than I expected.. I have been recording times with an app called WatchCheck, from Google Play Store, and over the last week it is only running fast by just over 6 seconds (an average of 0.9 sec/day per the app).  It runs slightly fast when wearing and slightly slow when off and laid vertical with 3:00 up.  They seem to cancel out very well.<br />It is very light thanks to the titanium construction.<br />I cannot comment on the water resistance of the watch since I have not exposed it to water, It does have a screw in crown that seems sturdy.<br />Some things I suggest for future models:<br />a) a larger luminous area on the second hand.  Hard to see in dim light.<br />b) better luminosity in general.  They are bright when you first go into a dark room but seem to fade fairly quickly, Basically, don't expect to wake up in the middle of the night and easily see the hands of the watch when it's on your nightstand.  There is some glow, but it is very faint, making it fairly hard for me to tell the time even when fully dark adapted. Maybe add red outlines on all the hands since the minute hand is much easier to see.<br />c) a domed crystal: this watch has a flat crystal and it does seem more reflective (see photo).  Have also read that domed are more durable, but I have not had any problems with durability of this one to date.<br />d) more watch band options:  I got the bund band and it seems it be of good quality and was comfortable but I also ordered a nato/zulu style band from Infantry Co., that I think looks sportier (see photo) and makes it less likely to drop the watch if a lug spring pin popped for any reason.  I will probably mainly use the nylon band.<br />Overall I think the watch is a good value (the other watches I had considered were Hamilton's that were considerably more expensive and did not have the screw in crown and therefore, were rated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it.ated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it.\",\n",

              " \"(*Full Disclosure* I purchased this watch elsewhere on a TV network so this is a C&P of my review for it)<br />For a long time I was teetering back and forth from choosing this or the SAN Specialty mirror high polish gold/gold, but in the end it came down to me preferring the face of the SAN IV which imo needs no explanation, the line has many beautiful combinations all of which being due to the great cutout layering of the Swiss cross throughout the dial. Getting on to reviewing the watch, a piece that hopefully will once again be in stock and available for sale again lest my review be in vain.<br /><br />It arrived and of course it was immediately sized, and resized and micro adjusted a few times, yes this is a watch and bracelet design that can be challenging to those not familiar with large heavy watches with SS bracelets, it's all about finding that sweet spot and then it's smooth sailing. I emphasize this because proper sizing and simple micro-adjusts can make or break your watch experience. Depending on the weather or season my wrist can vary quite a bit, so I size it as tight as possible with the links and then I'm able to easily adjust the band in small increments.<br /><br />Next up is the finish, wow what a finish it is! If you have a little OCD as I do you may want to keep a soft polishing cloth in your back pocket,lol but I am serious, it gets smudged very easily. About the extra &#34;clear coat&#34; as I like to call it, it acts much like the nickname I gave it. When I closed the safety clasp it was very tight and after 30+ uses I was pretty amazed to see that the finish was still holding firm, not even a scratch. Normally a watch that has a matte finish or SS will likely leave a good scratch on the clasp where the safety clamps down, not the case here. I've worn it A LOT over the first month and did several of my own rigorous quality control experiments which is, if you don't know, extremely important when dealing with Invicta. While my haphazardnesshas etched plenty of very fine hairline scratches, none of them even came close to the depth of the actual gold finish thanks to the clear coat polish.<br /><br />Finally, after all of that 30 day break in, the movement and chronograph have been 100% functional and the time is within one second from which I set it to on arrival, month date and snapback day of the week all working just fine. The Ronda 8040N is easily my favorite quartz movement. As for the flash of the finish, yea it's loud and blingy, not everyone can pull it off, but you guys can sort that kinda thing out for yourselves. As for me I love it. This marks my 7th higher end Invicta I've purchased in the last year and a half, all of them Swiss quartz and over that time every single watch is within 5 seconds of what I set it too. The bottom line is that Invicta's design team has been operating at a level of intricacy and making designs that are unrivaled in their beauty and function(when they do function;)har har, and this piece is proof of it. I really wish they would attempt to redeem themselves in the public eye by boosting QC and CS, but until then they will leave customers weary, even people like me who have had nothing but positive experiences and collectors alike can't help but to hope to heck they don't ever need to deal with Invicta's CS for warranty service, but enough of that, they know what needs improvement and as long as I continue to receive quality timepieces I'll remain I customer of Invicta.

I used it for one year and seven months before replacing it. I've changed this review from 3 to 4 stars based on the durability of the band over that time. The hardware held up without fault, aside from the loss of color. Towards the end the leather started showing it's age by cracking and stretching. This is forgivable since this band only cost a surprising $11 at the time. Arm staining continued for a few months before tapering off with no lasting effects.

Expect it to run +/- 10-20s per day and you won't be disappointed.  It can be regulated for much better accuracy - you can also learn to position the watch at night to make up or lose time as you need.  For me, that's part of the fun of an automatic.  It does not hack or wind if that's important for you.  Fit and finish is excellent in my opinion.  The case in particular is beautiful and you can easily trace it's evolution through an interesting lineage of Seiko divers back to the 60s.  My first (SKXA35) is still going strong after 10 years without ever being serviced (FYI it's marked mov't Malaysia same as the SKX173).  Even the Lumibrite lume and Hardlex crystal are like new.<br />I just bought this one for use as a daily 'beater' that isn't bright yellow.  I also really like the square indices, reminiscent of the old 6105 from my era...  The first watch that arrived had a misaligned chapter ring, bad enough my wife and kids could notice, so back it went.  The second watch is much better but not 100% perfectly aligned and the day/date sit low in the their window.  My wife and kids can't see it and think I'm crazy for insisting - so I kept it (but I know...).  For what it's worth, my old SKXA35 was/is perfect.  I don't know if QC has gone down hill or if I just got lucky on that one.  Anyway,  I do recommend buying 'Fulfilled Through Amazon' so you can take advantage of the easy returns if your particular watch doesn't cut it.<br />I might add that these are thickish watches at 13mm but wear well on smaller wrists.  Lug to lug distance is about 45mm, that's pretty short and I feel a better measure of fit on the wrist than diameter (42mm w/o crown).  I have a 6.25&#34; oval wrist and it feels fine and looks natural.  On a Strapcode oyster bracelet it feels wonderful and looks expensive.  On a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment.a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment.\",\n",

So if you like the feeling of knowing you have the watch on your arm, then this is a great option.<br /><br />The readout has a lot of settings.  There are stopwatch capabilities, including lap timer, multiple different time zone readout options, and date.<br /><br />It does take a bit of time (no pun intended) to learn how to use this sophisticated watch.  But once you learn the basics, it is fairly intuitive.<br /><br />Be sure you get the chronograph version (unless you enjoy regularly winding the watch, or you're prepping for an EMC and you want a watch that won't stop working).<br /><br />The only notable downside - the many readouts, and the instruction manual, are tiny.  My eyes are starting to go and I can really only read the &#34;big hand, little hand&#34; parts without the aid of eyeglasses.  Even the date is too tiny for me to read without eyeglasses.  So one star removed because of my aging eyes.<br /><br />Also, unless your wrist exactly fits this watch, you'll likely be taking it to a jeweler to get a link or two removed in order to size it for your wrist (but that's the case with any high-end watch).\",\n",

            "Scratches, It works well on me. However, I found cheaper prices in other places after making the purchase, Beautiful watch face.  The band looks nice all around.  The links do make that squeaky cheapo noise when you swing it back and forth on your wrist which can be embarrassing in front of watch enthusiasts.  However, to the naked eye from afar, you can't tell the links are cheap or folded because it is well polished and brushed and the folds are pretty tight for the most part.<br /><br />I love the new member of my collection and it looks great.  I've had it for about a week and so far it has kept good time despite day 1 which is typical of a new mechanical watch, i love this watch for my purpose, about the people complaining should of done their research better before buying. dumb people., I was about to buy this thinking it was a Swiss Army Infantry watch-- the description uses the words infantry and army--- when I realized it must be a fraud for $12.00. This should not be offered on Amazon-- it is designed to confuse consumers., Great quality and build.<br />The motors are really silent.<br />After fiddling with the settings my watches are always charged and ready to use., The watch was pretty much as it was described and how it looks. I really like the simplicity of it and it looks pretty amazing. It is slightly too big, so I have yet to adjust it, but I'm glad it's too big rather than too small. The weight is good which is what I was hoping for. Very satisfied with this purchase. I was slightly on the fence getting this one because of the previous fossil watch I had, which by some time, did have some gems fall off from ring around the numbers, but so far so good with this one! Excuse my bad lighting for my pic., I bought this watch on 2013, the screen had a problem 10 months later. I sent the watch back to Casio Service Center in LA, they sent to me a replacement new watch. Last week, less than one year after I received the new watch, the battery is out.  I went to a shop to replace the battery. Then the A button of the watch do not working, so I could not change the time and other settings. I do not think this watch is a good product. Do not buy it., It is a cheap watch that looks cheap.  There isn't much else to say., Heavier than i though, Had it for several weeks now and I love it - reliable, functional, wears easy, not too heavy.  I also get a lot of comments on it - great watch!, This one is different from the rest of my Invictas. I like the big watches but this one gave a classy more defined look for the craftsmanship. All of the colors compliment each other. It all starts from the stitching of the band.  Very nice watch., The watch is attractive and easy to read, except for the date. The little diamonds are very, very tiny. All in all, I'm happy with it., said my wife.., Looks great and love to wear this watch.  Only negative thing is due to its blue/black colors, it is difficult to read in average or low light.  Good thing for me, I wear a watch for looks and not really for telling the time., I really like this watch. It has a great face that contrasts nicely with the white numerals. Keeps time accurately. Overall very pleased. I really like its distinctive look. It's also durable and water proof. I leave it on when I go kayaking or out on the boat fishing., Works great but the watch a used it on was slim so I had to use a quarter to rase it up the right height, Just what I needed for my Timex watch. Fits perfect on my wrist, Absolutely LOVE this watch! Amazon prime saved me over $400 after tax from the store prices. Between the great buy and the Coolness of this watch it was an amazing purchase. I can't stop looking at it. Movado is an excellent brand. Time keeping is perfect. Quality is perfect., Its too large. When you order check the size of the case., This was a watch I bought during a quick sale thing, so it was cheaper than normal.  I bought it as a daily wear.  It's really a decent watch for the price; a retro look with a modern movement., Thought that I read somewhere that you could swim with it. It does not however bear the 50M Water Resistance designation., This watch is a very beautiful time piece. This also could be an alternative choice to a Rolex submariner. It also has the same features as a Rolex submariner but it's not as good as a Rolex watch but darn close.<br /><br />Take good care of this watch if you get one because it has gold plating on it. This watch is 'Not' a sport watch.<br /><br />This watch features<br />-Rotating timer dial<br />-All stainless steel (kinda heavy)<br />-Glow in the dark<br />-Water resistant to 200 meters (600 feet)<br />-Automatic winding (from wrist movements)<br />-Shows date<br />-Very beautiful<br /><br />Sizeing isn't difficult, I sized mine by using a thumbtack and a hammer to tap the pins out of the band and I tapped a pin back into the band after removing three band links. If you don't know what your doing then just take it to s jewelry store so they can size it for you, This is a beautiful watch. I love the look and feel of it, and I get complimented on it all the time. If that were the entirety of the story, this would be a 5 star review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most important part of this watch, the functionality, has some issues. Despite this being an automatic winding watch, it doesn't always stay wound. I have had days where I had to re-wind it before the end of the day. Most days however, it does last through the day. I just have to wind it and set the time again in the morning. Other mechanical self winding watches I own will in fact not need to be wound again until I stop wearing them for a full day. In addition, I can't always get the spring fully wound before it will start clicking and the spring skips off the winding gear.<br /><br />If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have returned this watch. Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window. So now I'm stuck with an only mostly working but beautiful watch. I guess that makes it kinda like a fashion model. When I think of it that way, it's not quite so disappointing., I was very apprehensive about buying a 28 dollar watch online, but it looked so much like the 400 dollar Invicta Coalition forces watch I was wanting that I went for it.  I was very pleased when it arrived.  It is a BIG, heavy, sharp looking watch and I could not be happier. I am sure I will be purchasing the solid black one as well, [[VIDEOID:cc599be25462207f860e42621171d7e1]]This watch has an understated clean and classy design.  It looks elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 7.5\\\\\" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8\\\\\".<br /><br />The face of the watch is 1 3/16\\\\\" wide and the watch is 1/4\\\\\" thick. The back of the watch states it has Japanese quartz movement.  The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so it is a somewhat confusing as it refers to self-winding watches as well as quartz watches like this one.  The third page in the manual can be used as a guide to the watch adjustment method.  I found the controls to be simple, everything is controlled by the position of the crown. It can be pulled out into two position, the first position allows change the day of the month, the second position moves the arms.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.  It comes in attractive package, the box has a pillow and include a gift bag.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI for review.  Getting a review product does not influence what I say, I leave critical reviews as well as positive reviews like this one.<br /><br />Ali Julia review, Awesome watch for the price, Nice face, easy to read. The band is a little too small., crap, This is now my everyday watch.  Easy to read with lots of features.  Light  and functional.  You can not beat the price.  It is clean in detail and I love the watch., amazing product keeps everything safe and secure organized great quality for my designer belts perfect for homes or traveling, Watch looks amazing and the features are second to none, but....the watch is small.  I have a PAW-5000 which dwarfs it.  I had to look at the box to make sure I didn't get a woman's watch.  No joke, the band on my, average at best, sized wrist almost couldn't accommodate it.  Probably had 1.5 inch left on the band after I put it on.  Make this Man-size and it would fantastic., Metal color was changed after the first use , which indicates a very poor quality, So far so good. I have only had this watch a few weeks & so far it is still working. Style is really cute exactly as pictured, Great product . Love the continous innovation in this field and given the price-tag of $149, this product is a steal . Bought it 1 week back . Battery is satisfactory . Charges fast . Discharges within 12-15 hours . But it has a touch screen, so naturally its going to eat-up battery. For entry level android-wear, pretty decent, A very beautul and well-made pilots watch. Highly detailed dial,as well. The movement is tack- on for 24 hours but if you are not a ditch digger,wind it 20 revs  daily., Comfortable, looks great, very lightweight.The band is a little on the short side, but it's usable and not a big deal to replace., excelent product, This press is very well constructed and sturdy. The different dies are easily interchangeable. A good tool for watches and miniature work., It was bad it didnt fit my 22mm retro casio, Watch kicks ass. Upon putting on this watch you will grow a full beard and be able to tame a pack of wolves by looking at them. 8/10 Only gripe is that I wish the back light was a tad better., Alrighty, after seeking out the ultimate low-profile, ultra water resistant, mechanical watch with a rotating bezel and date for less than $100, I settled on this.<br /><br />It looks much like the famous Rolex Submariner, and performs similarly.<br /><br />However, after about a year of use now, the paint on the bezel is chipping, and after a decent smack on the hood of a car the crystal has cracked and all but shattered.<br /><br />It keeps time fairly well, gaining about 15 seconds per day, without taking it to a healer for fine tuning., Not bad but a little tacky. It does have substantial weight for a $15 watch., I thought it looked beautiful.  My boyfriend loved it.  It's only been a few days, so I can't comment on durability.  But, I didn't have some of the problems mentioned in other reviews--the little dots around the outside glowed like they were supposed to, it was easy to set including the date, the band was fine and long enough even though my boyfriend wears it loose.  Great price too--I see them in stores for nearly twice what I paid., More beautiful in person. High quality! Looks understated but so sophisticated! It was a gift for my mother and she loved it!, It's a nice watch but if you have a large arm it will not fit  well.  does good under water I use when I go to water aerobic to keep tack of my time, Man watch for woman, just a right size and design for it., I like the watch!  I had its predecessor and enjoyed it until all the numbers started to fall off.  Hope that does not happen to this one.  The numbers run together it's sometimes difficult to distinguish the time.  I'm adjusting to it.  Like the new clasp., I have many Baby-G's, but none have gotten as much attention and compliments as this one. The glitter pops out at everyone and the silver makes it look feminine and sleek. I paid $120 for it, wayy more than I usually pay for Baby-G's, but I think it was worth it, especially since it's a special Japanese model. Probably won't see many people with this watch making it pretty unique. I like the background light is a light blue color, goes well with the color of the watch., Perfect watch for camping and hiking., The watch as expected was an amazing product from citizen, however the the cover was in a damaged condition which was quite upsetting since I was planning to gift this to some one., These were purchased for my daughter and her friend, but I liked them enough that I kept one for myself as well!, This is junk.  Why would you name a watch an ironkid watch if it isn't made for swimming (last time I checked an ironman consisted of swim, bike and run)?  It claims it is water resistant but the watch leaks and it will die if your kid wears it in a pool.  Don't waste your money., Lens cracked on the third day, My husband like it but he would have liked the dial face to be a little smaller. He is not used to the bigger face but getting used to it. The picture product was hard to tell about the dial face and don't think it mention about the dial face being bigger than normal. Besides that everything else is really well made., This is a very nice watch, i love that it's made of wood but black in color. The face is big and has three silver, decorative yet functional dials. It's extremely lightweight and comfortable to wear. It's so lightweight you could actually forget you're wearing it. The wood is very smooth and the semi-matte finish is very dressy.<br />The links move easily and is worn without catching or squeezing skin/hair. It's easy to adjust so it will fit a variety of  wrist sizesI love that it's water proof because although very dressy it can be worn for every day use.<br />This would make a great gift for any man in your life.<br />I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own., Love. That is pretty much it. Item as described, really beautiful and functional., So pretty, strap is so soft, easy pliable rubber material. Unfortunately, bezel does not turn. But I recommend this for everyday nursing use., The size and thickness is Huge. the color is eye Popping.The band is durable and ridged . the only problem I have is that it doesn't glow to mush in the dark. but I like it, the band broke in first week, This is exactly what I was looking for!  I fixed my watch band and haven't been happier!  I didn't need 5, but the extra 4 may come in handy., PERFECT, Disappointed by the huge size of it, although yes they say in the specs it's a 52&#34; etc...<br />Sent it back. The taxes and p&p cost made me pay for it again., Cool, first:<br />i received watch in good condition, however he battery was not working and i changed the battery<br />second:<br />i tried the watch to my hand but unfortunately was not amazing, it is for old ppl more than youth. i am looking to change the model .<br />i dont know if i can change irt from guess agent in Scotland/Edinburgh or not., This is a good looking men's watch that would go well with most outfits, though it's leather strap pushes it to a more dressy watch. It's a simple watch with a day and date window. It is luminescent on the hour marks but not on the watch hands themselves, which is a little weird.<br /><br />I would be curious to see how long the battery lasts. Aside from the watch band wearing out, that would be the weakest part of this watch in the long term., It's a great looking product. One of the best watches I have ever seen. The quality is mediocre but that's alright. Just keep it out of water as much as possible and the leather should hold up alright., heavier than expected, All perfect!, I got this watch on June 8th . I wore it for three weeks and the watch band fell apart. I called Amazon about the repair and was told  I had to call the seller as the warranty does not cover the band. I have never  had a ceramic watch band thus  I  have never had this problem. The watch is beautiful but it servers no purpose if the band is no good. I will try to call the seller for repair., This is an impressive timepiece that's ready for the business world., This product really surpassed my expectation. It was able to perform very well for me. I used it for my US Army Basic training and AIT. It never disappointed me and it was able to remain sturdy even after a series of rugged use. I highly recommend this product., It is so cheap and gaudy, I will never wear it.  It was misrepresented in the picture and description. The picture is darling but the real thing is beyond cheap.  It will go into the thrift shop donation pile., I bought surprised watch  gift for my daughter. It's beautiful and nice color. She really likes it., A beautiful and precision automatic watch。, Didn't like, Stopped working after one week. Have no idea why. Will try to return or exchange., handy, Love fits good use it every day., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, The photo provided of this watch badly distorts the color of the band, which is in fact much lighter than pictured. It is so light, in fact, that it practically blends into my skin when wearing it. But, I can just replace it for a few bucks, right? Wrong. Skagen apparently uses a proprietary design for their watch bands, and they also don't sell replacements to third party dealers. As far as I can gather I would have to send the watch to them and pay whatever sum they demand just to get a reasonable-looking band.<br /><br />Save yourself the aggravation: Do not buy this watch, or any other produced by Skagen for that matter., Beautiful watch. Love Skagen watches, hope they'll keep up the quality now the firm's sold. Have had several compliments on the watch., Don't buy this watch.  It looked fine when it arrived, but back of watch has already begun to corrode.  The wrist band turns my wrist green., the dial looks so big compare to this iamge, Battery or watch died less than 2 days after opening., I bought one of these watches in blue and although it is big that is the trend right now.  It is definitely not cheap looking as the previous reviewer stated.  It is a gorgeous watch with beautiful colors.  I am not sure what she was looking for but I completely disagree with her review., I like it!!, It was a gift, I happen to like watches especially with many dials (which I will never figure out) I hope the receipiant may have that ability.<br />The Band is cool looking, so the dial and the band were meant for each other.A truly good looking time piece and well made by a company who has been doing this for many years.If you haven't guessed that name as yet I will now tell you,  &#34;TIMEX&#34;, the price is right, get yourself one., Had it 2 mos and the battery dies. do they think i'm going to send it in for warranty or just go get a new battery. It must have been sitting around for years for the battery to go bad that quick. Buyer beware : great watch old battery, So the watch stopped working almost as soon as I got it but it's so cute that sometimes I'll just wear it as a fashion accessory.  Not very practical but all in all a good buy., 10 years old loved it.  Easy to use, water resistant, alarm, chronograph and has a light., You get what you paid for. The watch is so thick that it does not look nice as it is shown in the picture.<br />It reminds of $9.99 no name brand watches at Walmart. The band's design is not practical., perfect! everything as expected! Thank you!, My son loves it!!! Many great features, he said it is super comfortable, I would recommend it to everyone!!, I love this watch! Aside from being cheap, this watch fits perfectly my son's wrist. My first purchase was the gray one. Then I purchased blue for my husband. Now I'm planning to buy one for myself. It has a simple design and the size and thickness is just enough on my wrist. I really love this watch!, Garbage product that should be sold in a plastic egg in a quarter operated vending machine. I'd give it 1 star but I accidentally got it to work before it fell apart., Absolutely amazing! Perfect!, I've had this blue Chicane for about 3 years now and own another 2 Orients and they are still some of my favorite pieces.<br /><br />The Chicane is the watch I wear most often. It works well in both casual and more formal dress situations, the blue face looks fantastic, the movement is high quality and the price is pretty much unbeatable. You really do get a lot of watch for your money. You can usually find Orient watches discounted throughout the web, so if you pay more than $150 for this watch, you've probably overpaid. That said, I'd stress again that the low price doesn't mean low quality. The watch is accurate and, despite the fact that I wear it everywhere and in all sorts of situations, the face has yet to scratch.<br /><br />The only negative in my opinion, is the folded-steel links in the band. They can pull the little hairs on your wrist occasionally. So a higher quality band might be something to look in to, although, despite the occasional pull, I've stuck with the OEM band for these 3 years and felt fine with it.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great looking and high-quality watch that, like all Orients, is a phenomenal deal. Highly recommended., work for a week dont broke, Bought 7 of of these as gifts for my groomsmen and they all loved it.  The watches arrived within 3 days!  Watch looks great.  For the price and quality it was a great deal.  The size is good not too big for a square face watch.  Read the instructions on how to set the watch as because it can be tricky.  The subdials are quite small but still readable, and for a watch under 40$ with day and date dials still worth the money.  2 watches did arrive with dead batteries, but upon contacting amazon, they refunded me a fair amount to purchase and install batteries on my own., The watch is practical, stylish and very reasonably priced., Great watch, really pretty, NOT water resistant. This claims that you can even wear it in the shower... however, one day of wearing it in rainy weather and the face is foggy. Other than that, I LOVE this watch., Horrible watch. Don't buy. The crown came.off after one year with minimum use., Fantastic if you need a watch and have Android phone. If i didn't want to wear a watch i'm not sure i would need it. Keep you from getting you phone out so much for new updates and texts and such. i like being able to change faces and colors. i'm just starting to download games and apps for it.battery life is one waking day. charger is cool., Perfect watch for my elk hunt.  Rugged.  Big.  Non-glare.  Amazing backlight.  Super light.  Super comfortable. Perfect!!!  Thanks Amazon/Casio., Love the looks,quality  n sizes of watch. Unfortunately I could not get it working properly. After 3 days trying , send it back. I am sure it was me running out of patients., handsome watch. hands are a bit difficult to read., After two months of careful wear the cap/screw that holds the wristband pin fell off (and was lost) - and being that I have missed the 30 day sellers return deadline I now have a pretty much brand new yet useless watch!, Excelent for the price., I wish it was less manly looking (yes, I know it is a man's watch), and I wish that you had the capability of setting two different countdowns, as I use this for work breaks, but I'm still pretty happy with the features., This watch stops working if left on dresser for over 2/3 hours. This is happening since it was bought. I am not sure if it is the issue with battery or something else. after giving a few shake it get back its life and there is a need to reset time date etc. NOT worth the time. Certainly it is very disappointing. I would not recommend anyone this watch., I like it, It's a beautiful watch that I absolutely love, but it is running 3-4 minutes per month too fast.  It is expensive to fix.  I haven't yet looked into the warranty from Amazon, but it was a gift from my wife on our wedding I don't want to send it somewhere to have it adjusted.  I am just living with it for now., I was hesitant to buy this watch at first after reading the reviews about the band being too small. Now after receiving it I find that it fits me perfect! (By the way my wrist is not skinny). I work at a jewelry counter where we sell watches and this watch's band seems to be the average length of a normal digital woman's watch. Anyways, I'm happy with it., We looked at many clocks before coming across this one.  It looks very nice runs very smoothly/quietly.  We are very satisfied with this product., I got a deal on this watch at a local department store, but after I got home and read the reviews, my guard was up already. Well, less than a week into wearing it, I took it off tonight and my wrist was green. Ugh! Frustrating! These US Polo watches have great style and weight in a lot of cases, I just wish they would up the price by about $20 and put some real quality into them, like genuine stainless steel!  Some of the other issues I noticed include: pulling the crown stern in and out moved the entire movement inside the watch, the analog and digital times were off by more than five seconds within a week, the stopwatch time was hard to see in most lighting conditions, and, as others have undoubtedly mentioned, the bezel doesn't actually rotate. I don't expect much for the low price these watches are sold at, but several of those problems I listed are real deal breakers in my book, so back it goes tomorrow., nice but it's a really noisy watch.<br />you will hear it all time... literally every second ..., The strap was well made, however, I had ordered black and it was a dark brown.  Returned for a refund which I received quite promptly., Looks awesome., All I can say is this is an amazing watch. It's nice and heavy and looks and feels so expensive! I bought it for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loves it!, I love this watch. It looks professional and stylish without being ostentatious, and actually looks awesome with my glitzy but delicate engagement ring, adding a hint of classic menswear. It's sturdy and you really can't beat the price, plus I have relatively narrow arms/wrists and the size is perfect. It has a really nice weight to it and everyone always thinks it's much more expensive than it really is., Bought it for my girlfriend, she loves it. She works in the health bussines so she needed something easy to clean, that could get wet and that matches her uniform. Great watch and theStar Series on the dial gives the watch a nice look., muy buen producto, My wife really likes the cool blue silicon wristband and watch face on this Armitron sports watch. It's stylish and fun. It has many holes for adjustment, so even very small wrists should find the proper adjustment (our four year old could wear it comfortably). The setup was fairly simple and standard, with two time zones able to be set, a stopwatch, countdown timer, and alarm. The weekdays on the display are very tiny to read, and makes the display seem a little cluttered or crowded. It is easily visible under water, with little to no glare, and seems a solid sports watch with no frills. While you can wear it in pools and the ocean, you can pretty much predict that if you do that often, the bands will degrade and discolor--but then again that's why you wear your sports watch and not a nice one. Also sunscreens etc, are unfriendly to watch faces and bands., I wasn't expecting much for the price....It came on kind of a cheap necklace type chain, but the watch itself was actually a lot nicer than I had ever expected., I was looking for a Seiko for my husband.  He likes it.  Wish the face was glow in the dark but other than that it fits the bill., I am very happy with this purchase.  I have had it for a month and have used it to adjust the length of 4 watches so far.  Very good quality.  Easy to use.  I have saved a lot of money by not having to take my watches to the jewelers to have them shorten the watch bands.  I would recommend this purchase to anyone.  Delivered on time and without problems., I got this for my daughter for her 7th birthday and she was so excited. She has worn it everyday since receiving it. The watch fits her perfectly, with plenty of room to grow.It looks different from different angles, this makes her so ecstatic.she told me that this was the best gift she'd ever received., Gift for someone, I cant really comment on it., Soft, durable, comfortable band, and the face looks exactly as it does here. Reduces glare and the light up feature is great., Battery died in 2 weeks!!!!!!!, I absolutely love the design and the quality of the watch materials. When I received the watch, it was set correctly so I did not have to make any adjustments to the date or day for almost 2 months after my purchase. Sadly, when I went to adjust the date because it was off from having a shorter month, I found out this part of the watch was broken. I do not wear it often and am not rough on it (primarily worn in an office setting). The band and watch face still look close to new, so I'm assuming the dial was broken when I received it and I realized it too late to return it. This is the third time this has happened to me when ordering a watch through Amazon. I absolutely love Kate Spade designs and they are generally of a superior quality, but when ordering on Amazon, you typically get a product that looks or functions like an item that was rejected by the maker because of minor dysfunctions. The gold-on-gold color make the watch slightly harder to read and the date dial is quite small, but the pink hands really help with visibility. The leather on this strap is very thick, which takes some adjusting to if you are used to wearing lower-profile watches. It is also a light enough color that if you are wearing it to work and are rubbing up against printed materials, the band will get a slight discoloration from the ink. The watch face is large, as other reviews suggest. I have a medium sized wrist (~ 16 cm), but it does not look too large on my wrist. When wearing it, I can definitely feel that I have a watch on, but the size makes it look like a nice statement piece., I really wanted to love this watch but I don't.  Compared to the women's Timex Ironman Triathlon watch it is replacing:<br />1.  The watch is much heavier and bigger.  I really notice the bulk and weight on my wrist when I'm working out<br />2.  The date display is goofy.  The year is displayed first.  Duh - who doesn't know what year it is?  The month/date has a small display which is difficult to read at times.  I went all through the instructions to see if I could change this, but could not.  The Ironman defaults to DAY of week then the DATE of month.  That's what I need, and I need it to be displayed clearly.  Done.<br />3.  The display of the Casio can be difficult to read in bright light conditions.  I don't know if it's my sunglasses, the glare, or what.  But I don't have the same problem with my Ironman watch.<br />4.  This watch is double the price of the Timex Ironman.<br /><br />I prefer the lighter/smaller Timex with easier to read display for half the cost.  My Casio is collecting dust on my shelf, although I will admit it looks nicer than the Timex sitting there., I've had it a month so far.  It's not as high quality as the old one but I like the design.  Very convenient as a bedside alarm.  I find it loud enough, contrary to other reviews.  Quality is okay., Had not noticed that this is the very large watch face and band. I like the watch face fine though it's bigger than I anticipate. Silicone band seems cheap and it's stiff. Put on a leather band that I had for my other watch which was a smaller size, but made the band work ok., Bought this watch in 2014 and wear it at least 75% of the time including in the shower, running, hiking, kayaking, swimming, and all other sorts of activity. It only recently &#34;broke&#34;. Honestly, the circle piece of the face came off, but the watch still functions perfectly. Picture shows what I am talking  about. Purchasing another one and hoping it will last another 3 years!, Not what I expected...., coolest watch ever, Extremely well I made watch. It even has a solid stainless link bracelet. Deep dish dial and very beautiful., Amazing, I am extremely pleased with the product.  Excellent watch!, Too tight., It pains me to rate this watch with 1 star because I love the way that it looks and wears, but if I'm being honest with you and myself, it's a P.O.S.  I'm not a watch snob, in fact this is the most expensive watch that I've ever purchased ($190) and it's been the worst experience I've ever had with a watch. I purchased from the seller Area Trend on Amazon so I can only assume that it's an authentic Luminox but wouldn't be surprised to learn that it's a fake/knock-off/refurbished. When it arrived it wasn't running...Tap it and it would start running...a few hours it would stop again.  I sent it back and they sent me a new one (I had to pay for shipping and wait a couple weeks).  About 3 months later the exact same thing begins to happen...stop periodically and start back for a few hours.  Rather than send it back to wait several weeks and pay shipping again, I took it to a watch repair shop thinking maybe it's a bad battery connection but I find out that it is a faulty mechanism and required a new one.  My watch repairman orders a new mechanism from Luminox and installs it for about $65. Here we are at about 10 months later (owned the watch for a total of about 15 months) and I look down at the watch and the second hand has fallen off and is shaking around loose under the crystal. I'll take it to the watch repairman again, get him to fix it again, wear the hell out of it till it screws up again, but I would never buy this watch again.  Very disappointed in what I thought was going to be a cool watch to own., The smile on my significant others face was worth the cost the watch was prefect better then I expected, Better quality than picture sugests..., Happy with product, Very nice watch. I get compliments all the time and everyone asks where I got it. This is an excellent watch for business/formal types of gigs that doesn't break the bank. Not heavy on the wrist., Perfect size, light weight, and matches almost everything. A negative is it ticks loudly., Pretty much what I wanted, disappointed with the band. Very stiff, and the end was squared. Hard to feed through buckle., Love it ! ; got it for my lil brother & it looked just like the picture & didn't look or feel cheap. Only bad thing is I got it to help him tell time however the numbers are extremely small, This is a nice sports watch.  Bigger than it looks on the picture, so it want disappoint if that's one of the desires in getting it., I wasn't able to get this to work. At all. So it's sitting in a box somewhere., The Swiss Legend World Timer is a nice higher end quartz movement watch with dressy looks and nice functionality.  The watch is BIG coming in at 48.5 mm case diameter so this is basically a large man's watch.  I would say it wears small-average for it's size but again it's a big watch.<br /><br />It does have gold accents on it but it doesn't come off gaudy at all.  Overall I highly recommend this if you are looking for a large men's quartz watch for dress occasions., Gorgeous watch! Works fantastic. The dial is of the right size for my not so monstrous hands (7&#34; diameter at wrist - Left Hand), if you have big arms, this may look tiny. The two tone double lock metal strap is gorgeous. It has polished center links with brushed finish links on either side. I had to remove 3 links to fit well on my wrist. There are 5 more links that can be removed to fit ones wrist (so a total of 8 links can be removed to fit ones needs). Hope this gives you an idea of the range of wrist sizes this can fit. I love the big Yellow stop watch arm. All are screw in buttons and knobs, what I mean by that is, you have to unscrew the rings by the two buttons at the top and bottom and the ring at the center knob to make it work. Once you are done using the knob and the buttons make sure to screw back the rings tight, this I suppose makes it water tight. The small dial on the left is your seconds dial, the one at the bottom is your alarm and the one at the top is your stop watch dial. Surprisingly all of the arms fall right on the marker lines when they work, may be I got lucky or may be the quality of the product is that good...I don't know! The hour/minute arms and the main dial has fluorescence on them to aid in visibility in dark surroundings. I have owned this for little over 2 weeks now! The dial is supposed to be used to measure 7 or 8 different parameters, I haven't had a chance to do any of that...Sorry! I have to say at least three others in my work place have bought this piece in the past 2 weeks since they saw this on me!, I was very disappointed that the &#34;illumination&#34; is limited to the teeny tiny little LED section of the watch face.  Not useful at all for nigh time display., Recommended ..., Automatic movt,mop dial,open heart,44 diamonds,butterfly clasp,and on. This was an anniversary gift for my wife. The diamonds may be small but in the light- WoW ., The wife likes it n she's happy with the watch, Little upset....the hands don't match up with the hours and minutes...sad ...because it's a beautiful watch that I can't wear., Excellent watch for the money. Sharp understated design. Particularly good if you have a smaller wrist. Hard to find a Chronograph for small wristed. This one fits well!, Awesome and Quick..Thx, This watch looks good and real leather band but when you take it out of the package it feels cheap, lightweight, and you begin to notice the lack of beefiness, and masculinity points dropped. It lacks weight, but it would be good for someone that needs a watch that is light weight, has visual appeal, and isn't concerned about it getting chewed up or broken., Just like in the picture but the textured dial isn't as shiny as you think it is but still shiny., Bought this as a gift for my grandfather, its beautiful and looks just as nice and high quality as the more expensive ones! He loved it, great gift for men, who can be so hard to shop for. It's something they wouldn't buy for themselves but can still appreciate and use!, This is a gorgeous watch. I almost canceled my order because I was scared it might look to masculine for my female wrist. Im glad I didn't. The combination of colors with the grey polished metal face, stainless steal bezel and black croc band gives it a nice rich look. I have an average female wrist and it fits fine. What doesn't show on the pic or video is the number markers are indented into the metal which plays beautifully in the light. Its a steal for the price and works for a man or a woman., Beautifull watch im very happy with this piece actually i want the 1020 model, is the same white instead orange, The watch itself it fine, but the watch band is too small., Loving it.  Works fine, easy to set up, etc.  I used to have one of these when I was a kid, so it's the nostalgia that's really got me going., Very eyecatching obviously.  I found the back of the watch to have a bunch of different metal pieces which uncomfortably dug into my skin.  The weight of the watch, while noticeable, is not unbearable.  The band got quite discolored around the area of the clasp.  Mine is grayish black now besides being orange., I was looking for a watch with a brown strap that had a somewhat timeless look.  I almost went for a chronograph just because I love the way they look but for the price on this watch I couldn't pass it up.  This is a nice addition to my very small collection and it's my first automatic.  I only wear it once or twice a week but setting the time and date only takes 30 seconds so it's not a big deal.  I first thought the inscription on the band was cheesy but the more I thought about the words &#34;without liberty life is a misery&#34; the more I wanted the watch.  The inscription adds a little flair to an otherwise simple yet sophisticated watch.  The band has variations in the brown color so this watch can be paired with light brown shoes/belt as well as dark burgundy / oxblood shoes/belt.  It fits well and looks great., Beautiful., like them., not a bad watch but don't use it on water or else the it will stop working, Beautiful watch that is even nicer in real life. When first received placed on window sill for about two hours and has worked great since. Strap doesn’t pull arm hair and fit great right out of the box. My only issue is that the hands or numbers are not luminous. This was an oversight by me and should have checked before I ordered but no fault of Amazon or seller so they shouldn’t incur the cost of shipping to exchange. Overall a good buy just do more research before you order to be sure what you select has all options wanted or needed.I plan on keeping as everything else is perfect., the band looks good but it was a bear getting the links out to resize it without the holder to keep the band aligned while removing the extra links., Excellent Product, competitive price and quick delivery., This band fits my watch well and I expect it to last a very long time., The crown and stem fell out within 48 hours. The replacement watch HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM! So very disappointed with this model, which is a shame., Good quality band but it is about a half inch too short.  I can use it as is but it would be comfortable if it were a bit longer., Amazon sent me a broken one which I returned. These subaqua specialty watches are normally very good though!, I like the watch but I don't like the buckle on the watchband.  It's cheap plastic.  It would be better if it was made of metal.  Also, when searching for a replacement watch band, it is impossible to find a better upgrade.  All I could find to replace the band with, if I ever had to, was the exact same cheap band that it came with.  If not for the crappy band, I would have given this watch a 5 star rating., So far I have used the watch for a week. Looks clean and simple to use. The weather function is simple and on point so far. The band is comfortable and holds nicely without the end falling out of the loop. Havent used all the other functions yet, so I couldnt rate this watch five stars., The band is super small...the watch head-is much bigger-I really help-the band would fit the &#34;watch&#34; size...A bigger band would make it more appealing...for the price-you would think the band would be larger.., Amazing watch, Love every aspect of this thing and especially for its price. So worth it., Works, It's not really blue at all..., Love this watch. I actually purchased it for my son. It’s awesome., I recently went shopping for a new watch when my old Timex band started cracking after 8 years. Duct tape works ok to keep it together but I needed something that looks good on my wrist.<br /><br />I went to Target looking for a new band and I decided that for a few dollars more I could just buy a new watch and use the old one for yard work and working out.<br /><br />This model met all my requirements. I wanted a clean easy-to-read design with date and day, a comfortable brown leather band and a face that lights up clearly in the dark. So far after a few weeks I have been very happy. It looks as good as my $150 Seiko at a fraction of the price as well as keeps good time. It's still accurate to the second since I first set it.<br /><br />I am a medium to large man who normally can only get the last notch buckled in most watch bands. This band will buckle to the second notch. The advantage of leather is that it CAN stretch, so don't worry if you have large wrists. A few minutes soaking the band in water will let it custom fit even the largest of wrists.<br /><br />Design wise this watch has a nice clean legible design. I'm not going SCUBA diving or orienteering in the woods. I just want a nice stylish watch that will tell the time accurately at a glance without the distraction of nonsensical mini dials. The smaller case still looks good on my larger than normal wrist and doesn't catch on doorways or sleeves like a large bulky case would.<br /><br />I've always had good luck with Timex watches since I was a kid. Good quality for the money. The only reason I have an expensive Seiko was because it was a gift and I only wear it for formal occasions.<br /><br />Like the old ad says, it takes a licking and keeps on ticking..., This automatic watch keeps great time when worn regularly or placed on a winder. Holds time for at least 48 hours. It looks great....face is a darker blue than pictured under normal light conditions, but a bright blue in direct sunlight. The upper crown controls only the day of week, which can be set in English or Spanish. The upper crown screws down, but not as securely as the main crown.<br /><br />My only knock is that the band pinches the skin and hair on my wrist... plus it has that unsightly dolphin emblem. Do yourself a favor and either buy this watch with the metal band or replace the one that comes with it. I replaced it with a metal band for less money than it would have cost to buy it that way., I'm preparing to do my clinical rotation next month and this is a great, inexpensive watch for me to help take vital signs manually, such as tracking  pulse and respiration measurements using the second hand.  The interface of the watch is big and clear so I can keep track of the seconds without having to squint my eyes closely at the watch.  In addition, the company was very responsive when I reported that my watch had a stain on the interface, which they quickly replaced for me with a new one that came in a week later.  The band is kind of stiff, however the resourcefulness of the watch to help me take manual vital sign measurements is more of an important purchasing factor for me., A bit flimsey, Nice time piece. Keeps precise time and is sturdy to wear daily. Not super big like some., I've been wearing versions of this watch for about 20 years.  It's easy to use, easy to see the display, comfortable, reliable, and affordable. The small &#34;downside&#34; is that this watch is very ordinary.  Like the title says, it's the Corolla of watches., Worked great. Hope to get another 10 years from my Casio G-shock watch., awesome!!!, Cute watches for the prices. They are huge so if you have a small wrist you'll need to get some links removed ., I like the watch it looks nice and fits comfortably on my wrist. But I was looking the watch over and noticed that it is advertised as being Swiss quartz movement and the watch I received is a Japan movement. This concerns me some as I am not sure what exactly this means as far as why mine is different than the one advertised., The time knob is difficult to operate. The design could and should be improved., Returned it as it did not work!, All of the G-Shock watches are great. This particular one is of the same quality. They are very hardy watches and can withstand a beating. Definitely a good buy for this price., This watch is just awesome.., Seems like a nice watch and easy to read. Still unraveling the connection with the Seafire; now that I have the watch, I looked on-line at a Seafire's instrument panel and specifically the clock, the face doesn't really look like this at all. By the way, this is the stiffest leather watch strap I have ever encountered, hopefully that bodes well to longevity., it is beautiful and it works just fine, only used two days, one of the lug was broken., This is a great watch and I very much enjoy wearing it. I wear it almost all the time unless I am working in the yard or doing something where I wouldn't want it scratched or damaged, though I have no reason to believe this watch can't handle almost any situation. The black light does illuminate the number dial sufficiently, but as others have said, it doesn't illuminate the hands very much, and definitely doesn't illuminate the LCD screens at all. The watch is pretty large, so if you have small wrists (I have average wrists) this watch may feel rather large., bangles seem like they wont last, but im watching closely, It looks good and in the rose gold it is definitely an eye catcher!! Enjoy wearing it too. It looks great with my MK rose gold metallic Cindy large satchel handbag I also purchased on Amazon Prime a few months back. I'm a Prime shopper for sure!, I wanted a good watch for a value price to wear playing golf and this is a beaut!, junk, 👍👍👍, No instructions, couldn't get it to work.  Useless, Lots of compliments..., A very solid, good looking watch. It was given as a gift and was loved by the recipient. The Mother of Pearl face makes this watch stand out above others. So far it has kept perfect time. The solar feature is great. No more batteries to replace., the vibrating alarm doesn't vibrate for a long period of time - the vibrations turns off after 2 vibrations., I got one of these beauties.  Looks nice, the outside is very high quality.  The rest is the opposite.  Cannot figure out how to hack the watch to synchronize the time, despite the user's manual.  The time is hard to tell, one has to search for the hour hand of the watch, because the three dials are mostly black or dark, same as most of the hour hand.  Worst of all the big red 60 second counter hand which jumps perhaps every second, does not line up with the 60 hash marks on the dial, but only about half the time.  Guessing, either the 60 second counter hand jumps at different intervals and they are not equal, or the hashmarks on the dial are not spaced equally. After nearly 162 years of watch making, a manufacturer should be able to divide the circle to 360 equal spaces and also should be able to make a second hand jump exactly 1/60th minute, every second. Operating the watch is NOT intuitive, the three time measuring dials are impossible to zero once.  The watch measures, stops, as if has its own mind, one may need a six month course to learn how to operate it. Question:  Why Tissot cannot fix the shortcomings of the watch, as I am sure they read the watch collector's blogs and many dozen people point out the same thing, I did above.  I have over two dozen watches and this will be the first one I get rid of, gladly., I got this on another website in Dec. 2014.  Very adorable watch. I loved it. Note, the past tense. I watched my hands and rinsed off dishes (no deep water immersion), ordinary daily routines. Somehow water got into the face, and it stopped.  So be very careful of not getting it wet, the water may leak in., Good but fogged up after a few months and could not read face., clock meets all expectations, Perfect timepiece for me and to top it all it came as a water resistant watch. The compass is not always acurate though but thats not nothing to complain about because the watch has real 24hour operation, The watch came in a timely manner and in an absolutely beautiful box. The watch itself has a gorgeous antique styled face, the winding action is precise and tight and the casing is a total conversation starter. This watch is easily worth twice the cost., It's ok, This does not work with the IPhones, Perfect fit for my casio g shock watch model 2608., My 9 year old son loves it. It is a bit large on his hand but not too bad.  update: lowered to 2 stars.. 3 months have passed since we bought it. A couple of times when my son took it to the pool it got condensation which prevented seeing anything on the screen and this lasted not a few minutes but a day or so.   Now it just stopped working altogether., its okay kind of plain, Fit perfect, I also ordered the Batman watch and instead received the Superman watch.  Do not order this item if you expect to get what you ordered., Great product...5 star for quality... 5 star for being, and looking like the pic. This watch is sturdy and has lasted longer than any of the cheap plastic watches I've usually purchased in the past. I am typically the destroyer of watches because of my job but this one is still going strong and that is a lot to say for someone like me who usually breaks them in about a month. You won't be disappointed with this one!, Very pretty watch with an easy to read big dial.  I have a very small wrist and it fits perfectly.  Very happy with this purchase., Terrible quality and cannot be programmed without the instructions and the instructions that came with it were in Chinese. Terrible purchase., I generally love Time Indigo but this one has been a disappointment. The Blue band started fading within a few weeks and I've lost time several times. I have not yet determined what caused that since it is not constant just occasional., We purchased this watch for our son (just turning 10). It is a great watch and he loves it. I only rated it as a 3 instead of a 5 because the band was rather long. The watch is identified as a Kids' watch however, the band is as long as my own Casio (AQS800W-1B2VCF). Also if you search the model number for the &#34;kids&#34; watch it will show up twice, labeled as a kids watch and as a men's watch.<br /><br />In short, I think it would be fine for a kid 10 years or older. A younger child may have too much of the band overhanging., Very pretty, elegant, I needed this to replace the far too small original brand on my LG G Watch.  Perfect length for me!, Very pleased.  Beautiful watch and very fast delivery., Love this watch it is my third Invicta from Amazon , however it worked for a week then would not keep time, I was on the road so had a new battery installed to see if that was the problem, No,  So I have shipped it of to Invicta with the $28 check  know we will see what happens .<br />My other two Invicta`s have been great. keeping good time., Just whatI was looking for, This is a beautiful watch.  I have worn other watches by Kenneth Cole for years.  This is just as nice of quality as previous styles.  The rose color is softer than some other brands and looks more delicate and professional.  The numerals on the face are Roman and that also adds character to the watch., All perfect!, Bought this for my husband for our 7th anniversary. It really is a cool looking, trendy watch that fits his style very well., Very classy, a little spendy, but you get what you pay for. My son loves it., No complaints. It's incredibly light and it tells the time., super, Works will with my watch.Thanks, super slim and chic. I gave it as a gift and it has been getting raves - from the recipient and non-stop from her friends., I had a watch just like this but it was blue and the rubber broke and I liked the style and brand so much that I bought another in my favorite color. It is waterproof to a certain deep depth and the packaging confirms that. Has a speed timer, an alarm, a secondary time as well as the normal time and day month and year., Like the style, For forty bucks, this thing is solid and BEAUTIFUL!, excellent watch, I haven't been impressed with this watch since I purchased it 4 months ago.  First, like others have mentioned, the metal band squeaked a lot when I first got it -- it was very annoying to constantly have a squeaking noise coming from my wrist when I moved.  I was able to silence the noise with a few shots of silicone lubricant.  Second, the watch does not keep time very accurately, even when I wear it every day, sometimes winding it if I have had it off for more than a few hours.  In my case, the watch gains a few minutes every few days.  Third, despite the beauty of the watch in the photo, in reality it is very hard to see the silver hands against the silver background -- just glancing at it to see the time isn't possible; you have to look at it for several seconds to distinguish where the hands are, and which hand is which; I hate wearing it in low light, and often I only choose it wear it (as opposed to my other watch) if I'm going to be outside where I can see the face better.  Finally, and most annoying, the crystal somehow became chipped under normal wearing conditions a couple of weeks ago, and now it has moisture in it.  In all my life of wearing watches, I've never had a crystal chip; and I know I didn't do anything outside of normal use.  So now, because the crystal isn't covered under warranty, it's going to cost $45 for repair.  I've had a lot of watches in the same price-point as this watch during my life, but never one of such poor quality.  I won't be buying a Relic watch again., That's what I want, I have had some version of this watch for 30 years. There is nothing better. The countdown  timer is a must for me. Thanks for keeping it available!, Band is impossible to shorten. Uses very tiny screws. I bought a 0.8 mm screwdriver and could listen it., Looks as is as shown. Packaged well and was shipped promptly. Quality looks good so far. Definitely Recommend it!, Shipping?... Less than two days!<br />This watch is really nice. Reminds me<br />of a Panerai Daylight.<br />Works fine, I'm happy with it.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon, Love the watch!  Beautiful, bright and clear display.  This is my work and snorkeling watch.<br /><br />This is not a con.  I knew what I was buying.  I wish that Armitron would also make sleeker LCD display watches with large numerals for more normal wear.<br /><br />If you want an all around good, and very legible LCD watch, I can only recommend it!<br /><br />Bernie, Excellent quality. Solid. Would highly recommend., Great watch for everyday use!  It is big enough to see the time even without putting the watch directly in front of your face... so if you need a watch that you can look at subtly (if you're on a bad date), this is the watch to get! : ), The picture of the watch on Amazon showed chrome plated hands on the watch.  The watch arrived with grey metal hands on the watch which make it somewhat difficult to read in low light conditions.  Otherwise it is great!!, Great Genuine Casio Watch!<br />-Japan made (Quality Wise)<br />-Easy to setup<br />-Classy look (Thanks to its retro design and gold tone)<br />-It's for MEN! (Thanks to its black frame color and band design)<br />-A must have model of Casio because it's very hard to find in any local store or atleast just in Australia.<br /><br />Delivered a little late than expected but did refund the shipping fee (Carrier issue, not the seller). But very satisfied with the watch. Thanks!, Sun permanantly turns it browninsh. Forget it., clock meets all expectations, I bought this watch from Amazon as the seller. So I will first review the Amazon experience, then the watch itself.<br /><br />It's quite difficult when it comes to rating Amazon, thing is the experience I've had with them over the years is incredibly positive. What I can  say is, the watch is authentic and I had it inspected by a Tissot shop. The packaging was great and the watch box had all the catalogues with it. When the seller is Amazon, buy with confidence.<br /><br />The watch itself is really a true piece of art. The blue dial and the outer black case with the white numbers all come together in perfect harmony with the stainless steel bracelet. It's subtle and a looker at the same time. It's not small whilst not too big either. For me it's about the perfect size. It's a bit heavy, but this only adds to the great feeling you get when you wear it. The thing I love most about this watch, is that with a quick glance, you get the time, day and date. I definitely recommend this watch., It seems to be a very cheap watch.  Accurate time keeping isn't possible.  Band fell apart after 3 weeks., I love this watch but within a month, the clasp has broken. Really disappointed!, OK so I have had this watch for a few days now and I can easily say is the best cheaply priced watch I have ever owned. It fits comfortably on the worst and it has some weight to it but not too much. Just enough. I have gotten multiple compliments on the sport amount of time I have had it., Nice. Loops are properly placed for extra strap length. Heavy weave., Good watch links scratch easily, The band is made out of some type of plastic and when it arrived weeks later the band was stained or had some type of water damage.. Got a full refund so happy at the end. ✌🏽😄, Disappointing!  After receiving the watch, reading the manual, and setting the city and Day Light Savings Time.  The auto setting for Day Light Savings time did not work.  The watch also was turned toward the west sun for 4 to 5 hours for two straight days, yet it never left M (medium power setting) designation for the solar battery.  It should have moved by the end of the first day to H for high battery power.  I returned the watch to Amazon, and received a full refunded of the purchase price., Very fast shipping.  The watch strap was like described. I have a small wrist and it fit perfect.  I am happy with purchase., Bad Quality in this moment no working, The product is good when it works.  Within months of purchasing this, one side of the winder stopped working.  The seller sent a part that we replaced ourselves and it seemed to get it to work...for a little while.  Few months later, both sides of the winder stopped working.  Product works less than a year.  Contacted seller and was told no warranty.  So unless you are good with paying for something that last less than a year...would not recommend buying this., The large size is QUITE large--had to return it for a medium, for my husband who is a pretty big guy., Very v cheaply made broke within the first 3 days, Like it, All perfect!, Handsome watch. However two caveats; one, the attractive band is way to large. I had to buy a smaller one that cost nearly as much as the watch! Two, the second hand has a loud ticking sound... can be very distracting at bight., like them., I really like this watch.  The face is very big--really more the size for a man, which is perhaps why it's called &#34;unisex.&#34;  I can't imagine a man wearing it however; the  pink color and the glittery band make it quite feminine.  I would give this watch 5 stars except for 2 things: the day and date are difficult to advance correctly, and the plastic buckle is rather delicate--I envision it breaking at the point where the pin joins the buckle to the band., The watch is beautiful! It is a little bigger than I expected, but after wearing it, it is perfect., The strap itself is pretty great but it didn't come with the springs to put it on my watch (which every strap I've ordered online thus far HAS included) so I was kinda bummed about that.. It unfortunately doesn't look really good with my original white Pebble watch so I won't be using it after all - but it's a good strap if you have a conventional watch to re-strap!, The SNZH53 is a very good automatic watch at its price point. It keeps good time, has a decent power reserve and the deep blue of the face and bezel is very pretty. The crystal is fairly scratch resistant. Not as good as high end watches, but the hardlex will prevent all but the hardest bangs from leaving a mark. The worst thing about this watch is the bracelet. It feels light and cheap. If you're planning to wear it on an aftermarket strap, as I do, that's not an issue. Though it's a &#34;divers watch&#34; it doesn't have a screw-down crown so it's not really great for doing a lot of underwater wear. That said, I've gone swimming with it on and had no ill effects., This watch is very attractive, and I very happy to wear it., Products like these which need time to show what they are and how good or bad they may be, need TIME. We have not even given it as the gift we bought it fopr, and may be later they would be owner will advise how is was.<br />Please give these items time to prove or disapprove themselves., I ordered this watch online and I absolutely love it. It's true to the picture, very sophisticated. It's great for nights out. Overall an amazing purchase!, i wear it often.  works well, Classy!!, perfect, It looks even better in person than it does in the picture. Awesome watch, I love Nixon., Pelage dial with tiny jewels positioned at 10,25,40,and 50 minutes. There is a date function its a perfect size and it is comfortable. Oh, yeah, its also gorgeous., Husband likes it., Very sturdy and light., Very cheaply made. Battery doesn't even work, Too large by far! Cannot be adjusted., Love it, looks just like the picture. Actually a lot nicer in real life because of the mother of pearl casing and the grey leather and rose-gold contrast.<br /><br />Also, it is quite small. So just read the description carefully before you buy because it really is a small small watch. But I love it exactly that way, I think it looks perfect!, excellent, Very nice watch , very high quality and 80 hours power reserv is excellent future , love it. Due its size , which is on medium-small size, for perfect balans I recommend this watch for smaller and skinny types of wrists,, Black strap is stylish.  The holes are well sealed so they should not fray but I don't think you could add your own holes. The buckle is metal but slightly lighter than I expected - still it should be strong enough.  Although the band is 9.5 inches (24 cm) not counting the buckle there are no holes for the first inch so it only just fits my 8.5 inch (21.5 cm) wrist., Awesome watch arrived quickly, I wanted an outrageously styled and colorful watch. Boy did I find it., Love the watch, back light is bad but you learn to deal with it. Looks great. Directions came in Japanese so I went onto UTUBE and watch a video. Very durable I'm in law enforcement and have slammed it a couple of times dealing with bad guys and not a scratch on it.giving it 4 stars because of the back light., The watch appears nice and is a copy of what we saw on your site being advertised. But it is for a gift; and then again it takes time for the owner to use it and get back to us after  a while as to if it was a good watch and worked out well, or it was junk. Please give these item time for evaluation., This replacement band is not as comfortable as the original that came with the watch. The finish also is somewhat disappointing with excess flash around the openings where pins go. Would not purchase again., The watch indicates it is &#34;Indiglo Night Light&#34; but pressing the A button or the Crown does not turn it on.<br />How does it turn on?<br />Both the hour hand and the minute hand are very narrow and it is difficult to see in low light., Excelent for the price., This is a nice looking watch but I had to send it back.  I'm just an average sized person and it made my arm look like a stick.  Way to big for my taste., All titanium, eta 2824 movt, 2 butter soft silicone straps, watch winder- at less than $200. I'm not kidding., Sucks, Extremely Poor Quality product!<br /><br />I received one and thought all was fine.  A few hours later, it had stopped.  I tried to reset it and both hands moved together.  I pushed the stem back in and the second hand tries to go backwards occasionally and the other hands don't move!<br /><br />I contacted JewlreyWe asking for a replacement.  By the end of the week, I had the replacement.  That one is even worse!  From the get-go, it would not set.  I pull the stem to set it and the hands don't move.  I push the stem back in and the hands now spin around the center loosely as I shift the watch.<br /><br />I contacted again, this time asking for a refund.  Instead, they're sending me a 3rd one!  Will this one be any better?  Two absolutely total wastes as a watch -- what are the chances?<br /><br />At this point, I have two little velvet bags, two nice chains, two batteries, and two little owl-shaped paperweights!  They said I didn't have to send them back.  Note -- the little velvet bags do NOT have &#34;JewelryWe&#34; printed on them.  The description is wrong there.<br /><br />Update (9/12/15) -- I did get the third one and despite JewelreWe saying they ship from MA, it shipped from China.  However, it did finally work!  It has a visible flaw in that it looks like the owl is crying!  I have corrected the problem because of the two previous non-working owls.  I removed the big screw in the back from this and one of the other owls and swapped the eyes!  Again -- more work on my part but I finally -- after over 3 weeks  - got a working and pretty owl pendant watch., Looks as is as shown. Packaged well and was shipped promptly. Quality looks good so far. Definitely Recommend it!, All was as expected! Thank you., It's a real good watch, with great features (love the snooze).<br />Looks good too with it's low signature overall appearance (no visible markings about this or that).<br />However, that inverse display is awful !<br />Impossible to read the time !<br />With sunglasses in broad daylight - forget it (get your glasses off !)<br />In broad daylight, tilt that watch till you can read something ...<br />In low light, don't even try, just press the illuminator button.<br />Whilst driving the car and just wanting to know what time it is, just look at the car clock.<br />It's a real pity ... because otherwise I love it.<br />It would be perfect if it was as it is with as the only change a normal display (not inverse).<br />Got myself a G-9000-8V which is the same watch, but with a normalish display (orange) and a sand color - very neat and I can at last read the time !, Do not purchase the watch!  I tried numerous times to get this watch to function and could not.  I then realized there was no resource for support.  I have returned the watch and I recommend you not invest the time and money that I have., Band was scratched and looks like someone tried to fix it with a sharpie..., This is beautiful and heavy weight. Great quality. It's very unique and has wonderful detail. Love this piece, will definitely order from this buyer again!, Not sure what I'm more impressed with, the watch or the shipping. Great looking watch,  shipped to Australia in 5 days!, Nice looking watch, large but good looking and comfortable to wear. Very noticeable, love how it looks with included leather bands!, I suggest you do not waste your money on this ,bracelet was broken in less than a month  i use., Always getting complimented, AWESOME, I just rec'd my Bessky watch and it's nicer than the $50 Timex digital I replaced. It has a very large face and is very easy to read. It looks like I paid $50 + for it. I was hoping it would be this nice but really didn't expect it.  For $5.68 with free shipping I will replace this as required without a care for the cost. I set the time/date etc. and tried the stop watch without referring to the directions that came with it. Very intuitive to set up. Stop watch with lap time very easy to useTHIS IS THE FIRST REVIEW I HAVE TAKEN THE TIME TO WRITE IN MORE THAN A YEAR.<br />TONY B., I like the large number display its easy for me to see at night and for the money it's a pretty good value compared to other brands I like it., It's a very nice watch band. Good leather and is well made.  This should last a long time., As a former Rolex owner (GMT Master) for 35 years, I have been very surprised by this Stuhrling watch.  Yes, its' a quartz watch, not a chronograph, the band isn't as heavy duty, as the Rolex was, but still this 824.01 is very attractive and is working well.  Compared to a $3k watch with a $250 band, this is a good alternative.  Very pleased with it., Nice size, fits oversized watches very well.  Attractive looking case!, Absolutely beautiful!!!, Watch arrived without tags and was yellowed in color. I bought a new watch, but it looks used. Less than pleased with it., Excellent product!, All perfect!, This is funny story. The package it came in smelled like leather and the watch says Polo and looks so Expensive. I had to go recheck to make sure i paid $9.99 and not $99.99. I thought i might have made a mistake. I didnt. In fact there was not saying it is not affiliated with Raulph Lauren. Ive gotten compliments on this watch. To me its worth $100. I love it! You will too if you like gaudy. Once i thought i broke it because it fell on floor and a piece came off, but it was a piece for in case you want to adjust it and make it bigger or smaller., Excelent..., Ordered three of these in different colors, blue, red, and multi colored (orange, green, blue) for my two year old grandson who LOVES his &#34;Ganpa's&#34; watch collection. So my husband had a watch to give him, purchased these.  I purchased three to be &#34;back ups&#34; when one broke, there would be another one to give my grandson. The multi color has lasted thru baths, swimming, jumping and bumping of a two year old. The red one one is working but it hasn't been needed so I can't really leave a good review for that one. One day, my grandson came over without the multi colored watch so I gave him the blue one. My daughter said that my grandson was jumping up and down, fell on the floor and the watch broke when his wrist hit the floor. So much for the blue one., Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you., I love this design was so excited to receive it , but when I got it it didn't work. I returned it very disappointed., I will start from the shipping, I got the watch a day after Amazon scheduled the delivery day. Still it was kind of fast 5days. The package where the watch came it was an envelope And a zip lock bag with no instructions. but still no damaged to the watch! Now the watch, is a beautiful and awesome watch the materials are the same used by the big brands! The day after the delivery I used the watch and got compliments from many people! One guy even said to me &#34; hey awesome hublot wish I could afford one&#34; lol. When I got home I Checked hublot website and they look exactly the same as this watch the only difference is the price hublot 34k and this watch 34dlls!!! If you thinking about buying this watch please don't just buy it I highly recommend this watch is really really nice and for the price is just an awesome deal I just bought two more! If I could I will give more than 5 stars! Happy shopping!, This was the perfect choice for a replacement band for my Samsung Gear Live watch. I did have to notch the pin placement however that was easy the band not only works well it looks good as well. Very happy with this replacement., The metallic material is plastic. I really like the background lighting though, the colors help separate the digits and letters. This has lasted me for almost a year now, even after swimming in pools, running in the rain, and showering. Anyone who wants a waterproof watch for cheap should look at this one., Really pretty and cool watch.  My 10 years old love it.  Has multiple functions as chronograph, alarm (you can set 3 different alarms), light and it is water resistant ... it's a bit tricky to remember the order to press the buttons to program it.  Loved the color., This item needs a LED light to indicate when the item is on.  No visual to tell when on or off., Watching arrive on time and it is nice as I was expecting, Just the right strap and they included a second strap for free!, Looks good. Very easy to read even at night. Somewhat larger face than I thought by picture, The watch band fit nicely with my watch. It doesn't come with the two metal pieces/rods that attach the band to the watch. But you can use your old ones. You'll need a very small screw driver or small pocket knife to remove and replace the two metal rods. They are spring loaded so they compress.The thing about the band that kept me from rating it higher is the color. I expected it to be darker than it appeared on the web site. But it is still OK and very functional., Was perfect for putting the backs onto watches after changing the batteries.  Very easy to use.  Already used it on 3 watches., Incredible watch!  Very high quality and solid.  Looks and feels like a multi-thousand dollar watch.....seriously! Nothing about this watch is cheap. Everything: clasp, band, movements, dials, buttons, detail, even the box.....etc is amazing. Beautiful emblem engraving on the reverse.  Exceptional watch. I wouldn't be surprised to see Jiusko as a top-tier watch seller very soon!, First, the pros: This is a nice-looking, automatic movement watch for much cheaper that you can usually find. It's styled after the Rolex Submariner, and it can be worn causually or dressed up. The blue dial and bezel are the perfect shade - bright and colorful without being garish.<br /><br />But, it can't tell time. I've set it repeatedly, wearing it to ensure it was getting wound, and it's consistently fast, sometimes by as much as several minutes after a single day. You had ONE job, watch!<br /><br />I have trouble even calling it a watch because it's useless for telling time. I shouldn't have trusted a company who has a watch (distinct from this one) in their &#34;Pro Diver&#34; collection that can't even be taken in the shower!, Beautiful watch, very light, comfortable and classy. Great size face. I love  wearing it, I can recommend this watch. High quality and it has performed as advertised. A couple of things that might not be right for some. One it is a heavy watch. Two it sits on your wrist higher than other watches. Also because of the metal band you may needed to remove some links, as I did. If you have a thick wrist, the band does not come with extra links, should it fit you too tight. Again rated 5 stars for my use., Heavy, large, beautiful, Beautiful watch!, It's hard to set it and the buttons no longer work on it after a week, A lot of bang for the buck. I actually used this 24mm strap with adapters for an Apple Watch. Looks great, feels super comfortable. And yes, I'm a watch guy. I have straps that are $400 and ones that are super cheap. This one is a great strap for the money. The more I wear it, the more comfortable it gets, and it keeps it's look., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, Beautiful watch ... Fun but still elegant wonderful color much prettier in person  and wow do those crystals Around the dial sparkle., Watch works very well., Beautiful watch, receive compliments all the time, The previous version was streamlined and had a flow from maid body through band. This version has a bit larger body and band is not as heavy and feels a bit cheaper.<br /><br />Technical functionally is great., Loved it. Came really quickly. Very functional. Little tricky to set up date., I like the look of the watch and the fact that I don't need to buy batteries for it and that it is water resistant makes it a good purchase., I love my watch it's exactly as pictured. A boyfriend style watch with the copper/rose gold accents., This clock is pretty. Recommended., Just awesome! Ive been after this watch for about 3 yrs and i couldnt find it. When i saw it on Amazon again, i just had to have it. I also own the mod 9937 and ive been very happy with it. They both have a swiss movement, that is why its more expensive than japanese movement counterparts., Excelent!, Beautiful !!!!!!!!, Nice looking watch.  A quick wind and it goes for 24 hours.  Keeps great time.  No instructions, so no idea what the other dials or buttons are for, but it tells time so I'm happy.  If and when it quits, I'll look for another., Have a timex expedition watch.  Liked it and the band it came with.  After a year of heavy duty wear the band got caught and ripped loose from the watch.  I thought I would have to buy a new watch.  Ordered this band which looked similar first and I'm glad I did.  It's better than the original in comfort and works the same.  Even if it only lasts a year I am still money ahead., Awesome!., item is beautiful and you will get many compliments but the reason i gave it the rating i did is because the time does run slow, and it looks like there is some specks of dust of something in the actually encasement its self!, My daughter loves it. When I asked her if there was anything she liked/didn't like about it she said &#34;I like that it has butterflies, but I don't like that they don't come to live and play with me.&#34;<br /><br />So there you go, perfect watch unless you're a 6-year-old with unrealistic expectations., I was worried about buying an automatic watch at this price point. I decided to go for it and I’m glad I did. The watch seems well made and mechanically sound. I haven’t had any problems with the watch keeping time. It’s really great for such an affordable automatic watch. I have taken this watch in the ocean, water several times and also, no issues. Seems very solid. I would note, the band is terrible. I replaced it with a nato band it looks great. I would suggest this watch to anyone., I love the watch!!! However I only received the white one. Who can I talk to about not getting the black one delivered, Beautiful!, Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you., It came rusted. Do not buy this watch!, Amazing..., The blue faced diamond accented Armitron watch is very pretty!, As a watch person, I really love this particular model. I didn't want to take my Tag watch to school, so I bought this as an alternative since it really resembles the Rolex Submariner. I've got many compliments from people, most of them assuming it was an actual Rolex. So if your looking for a nice watch that isn't too heavy, stylish, and won't break the bank, than this is it. I already plan to purchase another one in a different color., Very nice for a solar watch, i've had plenty of watchs that were a bit better but i would buy this again worth every penny, i dont like it, Strap is great quality but the design is flawed. The loops for turning the strap back on itself are too near the buckle, meaning the tail of the strap sticks out a lot. I have a luminox branded nato strap on another watch which is much neater and more comfortable., Bought 2 (4 months apart) and neither is water resistant.  The description says water-resistant to 165 feet; the pool is 10 feet deep.  After the kids wore it the pool several times, the inside fogged up and the buttons became difficult to press and sometimes unresponsive.  Timex will replace it - if you ship it to them ($) and include $8 for return shipping and they recommend insuring it in case of loss during transit...  for a $15 watch.  Shame... my kids really liked the watches too., As expected!, It's a nice looking band (once I finally got the right thing- my order was wrong three times before I got the right product), but the coat of plastic over the top of it is already coming off after 2 weeks or so of wear.  I don't think this will last long.  But it does look good., Its OK.  The fit is good and worked well for a few months.  Now the light no longer works and the entire watch resets occasionally when the mode button is pressed., very military looking and functional, When I first saw the watch, I was so happy not until I discovered that the watch is not working, I was so disappointed, and the seller is something else, they said I have to send the watch back with my own money when the fault is theirs, it's very very unfair,, Works like a charm., Worn once and the silver disappeared underneath the band in 2 hours time. Looks beautiful on here and when it arrived a month after ordering it. Too bad it was only beautiful for 120 minutes., Nice quality ,comfortable to wear . The hands  are however small and with the dark grey background  it is somewhat difficult to quickly glance to see the time., Excelente!, Fit the watch with out problems. Nice color. Good price.  But the leather was thick enough that it rubs against the watch side causing the leather to have small tear where it rubs., I have only had this watch for a week but it keeps to-the-second exact time, at least in reference to my cell phone's time.  The compass is reasonably accurate, but I still need to calibrate it, so assume it will perform even better afterward.  All in all I am very happy with this watch so far., very sheik, Really I'm surprised  it's a such wonderful watch from timex I liked this model is unique and stylish, This watch is AWESOME! Very well made and after many years of use is still as good as when I bought it. Many compliments on the orange face too., There jewel missing from the interface may be form shiping, To heavy., The rectangular shape is very nice.I have received  several compliments on the watch.It is hardier to read in lower light because of the darker face and lighter numerals.You don't also want to push the light button to check the time., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, Great watch only had it a couple of weeks but I am satisfied. Looks nice and appears to be durable. This version with the black case and olive leather strap is for casual dress which is what I wanted for work and everyday use. The other styles would be more for dress I think., I have it over a month now seems awsome no sound great quality would recommend it. The gift gloves are too small in size should be a medium size, Band broke in two days the pieces are cheap., Piece of junk, I have owned this watch for two weeks so far. The watch itself (case and crystal) is very nice and machined well with polished surfaces. It was much thinner than I expected and sits well on the wrist. The bezel does not click and rotates with some effort-- but it looks good enough. The watch face has a nice metallic black finish and some contrast between the middle and outer edges. The lume on the hour markers does not last very long but the lume on the hour and minute hands last through the night (dim).<br /><br />The band is quite cheap and is made of hollow links but is quite comfortable on my wrist and lightweight. I ordered a replacement band when I placed the order.<br /><br />I am still measuring the accuracy of the movement but out of the box it gained approx 4 minutes over 7 days (~34s a day). However, after I opened up the caseback and adjusted the balance the watch is holding time pretty well (still measuring, but I will update).<br /><br />Overall, for the price this watch has tremendous value. I really like the no-nonsense design that works with hydro-static pressure and there is just something about the unique and classic look of this watch. Not to mention the price!, Nice quality! Very durable. It is very stiff though and takes time to break in., Great watch, nice deal, works perfectly...exactly what i needed. Recommended., Excellent feeling on my hands, as expected ., Really gorgeous watch!, This watch is more impressive in person than just looking at the photos. Very well made mechanical movement, elegant, yet simple retro design with a 40.5mm case. Slightly more than a typical dress watch but not oversized to retain that classy look. The band is a thick leather, embossed with a faux croc pattern that is slightly stiff and needs to be broken in. But it is a quality leather band. If you are looking for a simple but elegant dress watch, I would highly recommend the Bambino, especially at this price!, I love this watch i have ordered about 5 different Invicta watches from Amazon and i have never regreted it. I do struggle with gauging the size of the watch and this one was smaller than expected. It's a more petite feminine style vs the big boyfriend style watches. The only negative thing i can say about it is the mother of pearl looks more like just a white background you have to look very carefully to see some differentiating of color that you could be called mother of pearl. I was a little disappointed with that part only., It's perfect! Must buy!, I bought the watch knowing that it was not the best quality....Looks good but is not overly self-winding.  I have to wind it everyday so I guess the self-winding is just to maintain through that day. 3-30-16 UPDATE: Link pins are now coming out.  This is my dress/work watch so no I'm not scaling mountains with it on.  I have had better success with my &#34;drugstore&#34; watch that cost 10 bucks!   Down to 1 star.  Not worth the money at all.....would make a great paper weight though!, Different, Sweet, Feminine!  A little hard to see the time due to the &#34;busy&#34; pattern but I buy a watch more for the Jewelry effect and color coordination!!, The watch looks great and seems really well made.  I like the subtle blue hue to the face.  The bracelet snaps very positively and feels secure.  Good heft and size to the watch.  The only thing that knocks a star off is that the hands are hard to see because they are polished and unless the light is hitting them the right way they tend to blend into the face., WORST ITEM IVE EVER PURCHASED!!!! All of the watches broke the first time I put them on, I should have expected that for the price. But in this case I definitely did not get what I paid for, I GOT WAAAAY LESS !!!!!! NO STARS AT ALL, The watchband is exactly what I was looking for., Terrific!, I bought this as a present, and have been told that very acceptable and exactly what was wanted. It's very bright too, Very bad<br />Eager leakage and it is not water resistant, This watch has it all.  The basic features you expect (timer, stopwatch, multiple alarms, etc.), plus atomic sync, solar powered, and a nice backlight.  On top of that, it looks great and is very comfortable.  The size is a little bit big for my taste, but is still reasonable for my 5'9&#34; 170lbs body.  I really wanted to like this watch, but there is one major issue that caused me to return it.  The display is just too small, especially for such a big watch.  My main digital watch for the past 10 years has been the standard issue Timex Ironman 30-lap, and the display on this Casio is about half that size.  I'm a middle age guy with good eyesight, but I want my watch to be easy to read, and this Casio just falls short on that.  In the end, if you can tolerate the small display, this is a brilliant watch., A beautiful timepiece worthy of the Seiko name. This watch has the quality of a much more expensive brand get does it all for less money., Beatyfull, Update on 8/4/16 - the watch stopped working (battery) on 8/3/2016 which is less than a year after purchase (8/19/15).<br /><br />I bought this based on another product experience - [[ASIN:B005DRE6UU Invicta Men's 1431 Sea Hunter Black Dial Rubber Watch]] it has issues when wearing for extended period of time.<br /><br />Issues: Strap breaks, second hand stops and the two brackets to keep the strap in place break off. Also because the watch has a second hand +date the time will eventually slow down, so the correct time will not be kept. This is a design fault.<br /><br />The silver 1431 watch looks better on your wrist than the 1432.<br /><br />Still... it's okay for everyday wear., Watch Face smaller than expected but dope watch. I love it. And I don't know what these other 'reviewers' are talking about because the band is very comfortable., It is so big,the watch is not suitable for me., excelente, Awesome watch for an awesome price at the time. I got this for my son's grad gift. He loves it. Shipping was prompt., Got wrong watch, it was just what I was looking for, fore my wife, I bought this red watch for my daughter's birthday. I opened the box and it is PINK! Not her favorite. I'm not sure where the problem truly lies. The only problem is the color., Still trying to figure out all of the settings., It’s a good watch band. I changed the original band on my diver watch and it complements it well. The materials are nice, both, the metal pieces and the nylon., I love this tiny watch since I like black and it's very delicate. Suitable for little bit thin wrist., Not an OEM band. Yes, this band says Seiko and is sturdy, but is sturdy to the point where I have found it uncomfortable for constant wearing. The band is not near as soft and pliable as the one which came with my original Black Monster watch. It looks vey similar, but again is not the original., It's cute. It's fairly lightweight. Makes a charming keychain. The watch, which is what it was bought for is not as charming. The hinge is awkward and hard for my mother's hands to operate. We've had it only a few months and already it is no longer keeping time. Could be the battery but that seems doubtful., Didn't realize this came from China. There's a reason it was so cheap - it's kind of crappy. Watch face came cracked., Watch works as described. I only wish the dial used luminous paint for the numbers and hands. I like the watch alot., I like this Timex Expedition watch a lot. The Indiglo feature means that I can now read my watch in the dark. My old Timex not only kept the exact time for more than 10 years but was still waterproof till the end., Face is too small. Need glasses to read time. Item returned., I didn't order the pins so I haven't had a chance to attach it to my watch yet but the look and feel of the band seems good.  It's a plain watch band, no designs at all.  the pictures are misleading.  the &#34;designs&#34; are on the underside of the watch band.  when attached, the smooth, plain side is showing.  at first I wasn't happy about that but I think it will be fine.  the texture and materials are perfect tho., I like it very much \u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a\u001a, The time on the watch goes faster than normal time so I have to keep changing it and it's hard to see anything on it during the day (practically impossible when you're running.), I like this watch so far.  I've been a fan of Seiko watches but last year decided to  try Fossil as highly recommended by a Macy's staff due to frequent hand washing for nurses.  I was hoping not to have the replace the battery every year as needed by my previous Seiko watch and have to deal with the poor watch sealing after battery replacements. I was wrong.  The battery in my Fossil watch died within a year.  I took it back to Macy but they refused to fix it because I've misplaced my receipt and Macy could not find the  online receipt either. I ended up taking it to a jewel store for battery replacement.  It worked for approx a week after the battery replacement but died again, probably due to the poor sealing of the watch by the jeweler.  I did not want to spend the extra money to send it back to Fossil for repair either.  I did some checking and decided to try this Seiko solar watch since the solar Seiko watch i've bought for my husband several years ago still work. So far it has been working great.  The face and numbers are large enough to read and the red second-hand allows me to count heart and respiration rates incrementally well.  I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 because the date and the day of the week displayed on the watch do not always match and will take some time to get them to display right. I am happy with my new Seiko solar watch., Sent as a gift.  No instructions though, on how to set the date/time.  Figured out the time on our own, but not the date., This is a quality tool kit that will pay for itself many times over again through usage.  It has everything you would want for the DYI man.  My husband has a collection of watches and is a craftsman in another trade so he is picky about his tools.  He was delighted with this purchase.  The price is deceptively low.  I truly was not expecting the quality that I got., Looks great, the band on the black version actually looks somewhat brown. If you have a small wrist this is not a watch for you, you will have a few inches of extra band sticking out and catching on your shirt and stuff., Arrived earlier than we thought. My son is happy to have it. Easy to wear and to adjust the time. Fits well in his little arms. Overall happy with the product., broke as soon as i got it, I'm always a little skeptical when there's a big difference in price between products, after all, you get what you pay for.  In this case, this watch band is more than worth the price paid. I replaced a Citizen watch band, and this band is just as comfortable and a little more stylish than the original.  I highly recommend this product., Dead battery.  Sent it back for another of same model and the next watch came. Guess what. ANOTHER DEAD BATTERY., Really fun looking and iconic alarm clock at a reasonable price for a Star Wars fanatic!  Clock works just fine as does the alarm., Easy to install and exact replacement, Very cheap quality....I should have gone by the price to know how cheap it would be. It is huge on me and I cannot find and pins to remove in order to remove links to make it smaller. For some reason it came with 2 of the same watches...I only ordered one. Although, I do like the way it looks., too bad a little time after no working more, The watch was massive. I took it to a jeweler and had three links taken out. It was okay for two weeks, and then broke. I think the screws were just poor quality., The strap is a bit more maroon than red, but a great color overall. Light weight overall. You can definitely hear the second hand tick, but this is not a problem for me., I like the watch.  Had to take it to a jeweler to have it sized, as we couldn't find a screw driver small enough to remove the screws.  The watch is very comfortable and easy to read., I am extremely pleased with the product., Bad quality. Stop working within a week after I got it., My eyesight isn't great, especially in dim light. I really like everything about it. The large black face with white numbers and hands makes it so easy to read. The Indiglo light makes it perfect for me. The style, with an adjustable leather band, contrasting white stitching and silver color casing, is very appealing. It was more than $10.00 below retail. At $36.99 you can't beat the value. To me, Timex has always been one of the most reliable and durable brand on the market. I don't need an expensive watch for a status symbol. I just want an attractive watch that tells me the time accurately and is dependable. Timex still makes a great watch at an excellent price., Ordered three of these in different colors, blue, red, and multi colored (orange, green, blue) for my two year old grandson who LOVES his &#34;Ganpa's&#34; watch collection. So my husband had a watch to give him, purchased these.  I purchased three to be &#34;back ups&#34; when one broke, there would be another one to give my grandson. The multi color has lasted thru baths, swimming, jumping and bumping of a two year old. The red one one is working but it hasn't been needed so I can't really leave a good review for that one. One day, my grandson came over without the multi colored watch so I gave him the blue one. My daughter said that my grandson was jumping up and down, fell on the floor and the watch broke when his wrist hit the floor. So much for the blue one. But this one again, is awesome!, The quality is wonderful and it's stylish., Simple but cool., This is my 3rd versioon, It is cheap and I didn't expect a lot. But my question is: is it a male watch? The bracelet is a little too short for my hand and my arm. Half centimeter longer should be enough to fit comfortable, I ordered this watch on ebay but it had to go back due to a defective date wheel. The unscrupulous seller tried to say I didn't align the 24-hour dial with the main display but I did. Despite the inconvenience I learned that I really loved how this watch looks and wanted to replace it ASAP!<br /><br />Anyhow, over a month in to the one I ordered on sale from amazon and I couldn't be happier. It keeps excellent time, losing only one-minute every 4-5 days. The date wheel works as it should, and the compliments keep pouring in.<br /><br />I can't afford a $26K Hublot with industrial rise gold appointments, but this sub-$200 Diesel has to be one of the best values around. I love its sculpted dials and the large display is easy to read, along with luminescent accents when the lights go out. The leather band is glove soft and I do believe that this will last me many years. I like the chronograph option too and am getting used to using it for various applications.<br /><br />All-in-all, a killer watch! Highly recommended!!!, Not please with  it, For the price, looks fine., If you are looking for a basic Casio watch that looks like a G-Shock, but is a more reasonable size, this is the watch to get.  The only reason I returned it is because I was between sizes on the band.  It was either too loose or too tight.  Otherwise, I would have kept it., JUST AS DESCRIBED, Very light., Comfortable Band, Easy to Wear.<br />I work night time hours outdoors and have been looking for a solid watch that I can see at night and that I can depend on.<br />This watch is Simple, Straightforward, Rugged and Dependable. I almost feel like buying a second one so that if something ever happened to the one I'm wearing that I would have a replacement ready to go.<br />I don't usually give anything a 5 Star Rating....but this Luminox deserves it.<br />Great Piece of Equipment., not fair to ding the watch as other reviewer did because it is too big for him...it is lightweight and a super watch., They work like they should., Perfect, it doesn't work, dissapointed, What a nice and simple watch. after adjustment my wife like to were it out when we cruise, The wife likes the watch, it was a good deal...----, For a very inexpensive watch I was pleasantly surprised! Construction was solid.  Band feels cheap and lightweight and appears to be like aluminum but so far holds up well. It is an automatic but also has a mechanical winder as well.  For $15 dollars you can't go wrong., Nice watch! The color of the band and body aren't common so that's pretty cool! The watch itself is pretty heavy so it seems like pretty good quality.  I got it on sale for less than 80 bucks so that was a great deal!, We bought this as a birthday present for my father-in-law and he loves it! Couldn't stop showing it off.<br />Very well made and does not look cheap which is always my fear with gold tone watches., excelente, Fine watch,, but can not hear alarm..., A beautiful, supremely functional time piece.  It does take a while to charge, but if you take the time to follow the instructions in the manual, you get to watch it setting itself, keeping time perfectly, and impressing the onlookers with its heavy, functional construction and function., BEAUTIFUL ,, This watch is more beautiful in person than it is in the picture.  I love the royal blue color.  I love the big face with all the big and small lines for the numbers.  This makes reading time easy which is important to me.  The hands are glow in the dark.  The wristband is skinny making it feminine looking.  By the way it looks, you can tell that it is a good quality watch.  This watch is perfect for me., After few month paint started peeling off!, I have bought 8 of these as a gift. Their Solar. You can swim with them. Light and double hour. Get it!, Works as expected but very loud clicking noise., We bought this watch for our daughter and she loves it. She's only 3 and can't actually tell time yet but she wears it all the time. Its nice that its waterproof and the band makes it easy for her to take on and off.And she was excited to the cool 3D texture. Good purchase., I have never found a watch I like more than this one in terms of features and functionality, but over the years, the quality has seen a sharp decline.  I have found the need to replace it at least once a year, not because of the watch, but because the band inevitably breaks.  After reading several reviews with the same complaint, I contacted Timex customer service: custserv@timex.com.<br /><br />Timex replied the same day and offered to fix or replace the watch for $10.  They sent instructions along with a pre-paid mailing label so I could send the watch and check.  By the next week, I had a new watch.<br /><br />The inconvenience is a pain, but I was impressed with their customer service and am happy to have my tried and true watch back without having to purchase a brand new one., The band fit my watch LG RW watch perfectly.  It does give the watch a great look to it.<br />I tried to size the band myself but was not successful. I ended up taking the watch and band to a jeweler to have it sized. It cost about $12 money well spent.<br />Mike, The watch looks great and is as described. A bit smaller, than I thought (I actually thought I ordered a female watch).<br /><br />Cons: I do not like the stretchy band aspect. Catches my arm hair a lot, and can be quite painful., Doesn't fit a large wrist. Tells great time, easy to read., Zodiac is now one of the best brands I own. Apart from the watch being beautiful, well built and easy to read during bright light and at night; it's extremely comfortable to wear!! This is now my second Zodiac, I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, the package was open and the battery was dead! very poor way to sell a product., This my first ever automatic /mechanical watch that I have owned and so far so good. Great looking watch and the cost did not break the bank. I was somewhat apprehensive not being able to physically see the watch before I purchased it, but the price was favorably discounted compared to prices for same watch at department stores. Overall very please so far., the watch has met all my expectations, and is now my everyday wear!, I was not too impressed by the look and feel of this watch. Looks very generic and cheap. I was hoping for a better quality from Seiko - kinda disappointed. But thankful for Amazon's easy return policy - I was able to return it and get a full refund.<br /><br />The dial of the watch is very small. I usually wear a 42mm diameter watches but these are much smaller then the 42mm diameter watches that I have.<br /><br />Sorry Seiko, maybe next time., Excellent watch if you like the colors. Whether or not you like it will probably depend on personal preference really. But the material is fantastic!, If you are anything like me, you have been looking at some of the Casio Protrek watches, like the PRG-270 or PRW-3000.  No doubt, sweet looking watches with tons of great features.  However, those watches are either too big or too expensive, or both.<br /><br />Enter the SGW-100.  Almost the same features as its more expensive siblings, but at a fraction of the cost.  Also, the size is much more reasonable.  Not too big (and ridiculous), not too small.  And it has a real backlight, not the weak 1980's amber LED light that shines from the bottom left corner, like too many lower price Casio's., very beautiful, I thought it said made of wood in the description but it wasn't. One corner was not glues together. I had to return it., Ehh, wasn't crazy about this watch at all. Looks very cheap and cheesy but now that I have it seems silly to send it back, This watch stopped working in about 5 weeks., Face plate broke on my fiance after 2 days.  Horrible choice, Well built, everything you'd expect from a Swiss Army., gets broken easily, Cool watch. Looks more expensive than it is. This watch will look good with dressy clothing., Cool kids watch with unique layout for telling time., Junk! Went swimming in pool & watch filled up with water almost instantly. This happened on the last day (30 days) of warranty so no refund. :(, The watch is lovely but beware the bracelet.  It is very difficult to adjust unless you're a jeweler.  My husband (who is very handy) tried to remove some links and the strap broke very easily.  Pay to have a jeweler adjust the fit., Strap looks better in real life, love the watch itself!!!, WAY too BIG and awkward (size not obvious in the pictures)., I purchased this Casio watch a week ago to replace a much more expensive watch that kept giving me problems, first with water leakage, then with a faulty band.  It's a nice-looking watch with high-visibility numbers and hands.  Setting the time was easy, and it's keeping accurate time.  The band seems rugged.  I haven't done anything abusive to it yet, so I don't know how the crystal will hold up (the super-hard crystal was one thing I loved about my troublesome old watch).  The Casio does not have a screw-down crown to keep out moisture, but I've been wearing it in the shower with no signs of moisture problems yet.  So, all-in-all, I'm quite pleased with the watch, especially for the price.  I didn't give it five stars because, really, how much can you love a cheap watch like this?  But in terms of value for the money, it's definitely looking like five stars so far., The watch starting losing time almost immediately., I received my watch in a very timely matter and it was packaged better than my previous G-Shock from the store. I love every aspect of this watch. It's great for my job and stylish enough to wear outside of work., Amazing, outstanding, and beautiful watch!<br />All I have to do is get a link or two taken out., The strap of the watch was cut after using the watch for only 2 days<br />Don't buy this watch, I can't really personally give a review here because it was a gift for my boyfriend. He's a watch collector though with some pretty expensive taste (his next &#34;reasonably priced&#34; watch that he wants is over $3,000). He loves this watch and wears it at least once a week., This watch will not allow for second hand setting.  Two other watches were sent and they too could not set second hand.  Just be aware that these Seiko watches are not made in Japan!, This watch is awesome, it's a high quality design. The product arrived 2 weeks earlier than estimated., This watch was enormous on my wrist. I will be returning it. I like the looks of the watch quite a lot, but just too big,, That's too bottons not working. Only accesoris?, Very cute and durable, clock meets all expectations, This watch is beautiful , fits great, and is a fantastic buy.  The photo on this site does not do justice for how this item really looks in person., Beautiful, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Beautiful watch and bracelet.  Not a bad color so it doesn't scream fake but the clamp is very hard to open so it's not that easy to put on., The watch itself it fine, but the watch band is too small., I bought this watch for my girlfriend, she was so happy when I gave it to her, very nice I really recommend, Disappointed!  Boring due to same color on the band, the trim and he face!!, This watchband literally fell apart after 6 weeks of wear.  The leather at the connection to the watch started to pull apart, but before that part broke, the leather at the buckle gave way and the buckle fell off.  Since there was no way to repair it, it went in the trash., I had purchased one of these last year, but had dropped it and cracked the crystal. I liked the watch, sturdy but not large and thick like many pro divers. However, when I ordered another recently it came with a dead battery and I sent it back. That process went smoothly, but I decided to go another route., The blue is very dark, almost a black.  Not as light as the picture shows., This was a great buy and a beautiful watch, but I returned it because the face was really large, the band was very loose, and it's too &#34;flashy&#34; for wearing it with my normal wardrobe. I think if you were dressed up for a special occasion, it might be just right. It's hard to rate it with the stars, so I put three., Have had this watch for one week and am very pleased with it so far.  It is my first automatic watch and is more accurate than I expected.. I have been recording times with an app called WatchCheck, from Google Play Store, and over the last week it is only running fast by just over 6 seconds (an average of 0.9 sec/day per the app).  It runs slightly fast when wearing and slightly slow when off and laid vertical with 3:00 up.  They seem to cancel out very well.<br />It is very light thanks to the titanium construction.<br />I cannot comment on the water resistance of the watch since I have not exposed it to water, It does have a screw in crown that seems sturdy.<br />Some things I suggest for future models:<br />a) a larger luminous area on the second hand.  Hard to see in dim light.<br />b) better luminosity in general.  They are bright when you first go into a dark room but seem to fade fairly quickly, Basically, don't expect to wake up in the middle of the night and easily see the hands of the watch when it's on your nightstand.  There is some glow, but it is very faint, making it fairly hard for me to tell the time even when fully dark adapted. Maybe add red outlines on all the hands since the minute hand is much easier to see.<br />c) a domed crystal: this watch has a flat crystal and it does seem more reflective (see photo).  Have also read that domed are more durable, but I have not had any problems with durability of this one to date.<br />d) more watch band options:  I got the bund band and it seems it be of good quality and was comfortable but I also ordered a nato/zulu style band from Infantry Co., that I think looks sportier (see photo) and makes it less likely to drop the watch if a lug spring pin popped for any reason.  I will probably mainly use the nylon band.<br />Overall I think the watch is a good value (the other watches I had considered were Hamilton's that were considerably more expensive and did not have the screw in crown and therefore, were rated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it.ated less water resistant).<br />I would definitely buy this watch again and recommend it., Exactly what I was looking for, inexpensive, fast delivery., Beautiful watch, This watch SMELLS so bad you can not even wear it! Stinks like mildew. It looks ok but wasted my money on it because the smell is atrocious., Simply beautiful, far exceeded my expectations!!! Highly recommend it!!! Perfect for everyday wearing and goes with any attire!!! Very satisfied., (*Full Disclosure* I purchased this watch elsewhere on a TV network so this is a C&P of my review for it)<br />For a long time I was teetering back and forth from choosing this or the SAN Specialty mirror high polish gold/gold, but in the end it came down to me preferring the face of the SAN IV which imo needs no explanation, the line has many beautiful combinations all of which being due to the great cutout layering of the Swiss cross throughout the dial. Getting on to reviewing the watch, a piece that hopefully will once again be in stock and available for sale again lest my review be in vain.<br /><br />It arrived and of course it was immediately sized, and resized and micro adjusted a few times, yes this is a watch and bracelet design that can be challenging to those not familiar with large heavy watches with SS bracelets, it's all about finding that sweet spot and then it's smooth sailing. I emphasize this because proper sizing and simple micro-adjusts can make or break your watch experience. Depending on the weather or season my wrist can vary quite a bit, so I size it as tight as possible with the links and then I'm able to easily adjust the band in small increments.<br /><br />Next up is the finish, wow what a finish it is! If you have a little OCD as I do you may want to keep a soft polishing cloth in your back pocket,lol but I am serious, it gets smudged very easily. About the extra &#34;clear coat&#34; as I like to call it, it acts much like the nickname I gave it. When I closed the safety clasp it was very tight and after 30+ uses I was pretty amazed to see that the finish was still holding firm, not even a scratch. Normally a watch that has a matte finish or SS will likely leave a good scratch on the clasp where the safety clamps down, not the case here. I've worn it A LOT over the first month and did several of my own rigorous quality control experiments which is, if you don't know, extremely important when dealing with Invicta. While my haphazardnesshas etched plenty of very fine hairline scratches, none of them even came close to the depth of the actual gold finish thanks to the clear coat polish.<br /><br />Finally, after all of that 30 day break in, the movement and chronograph have been 100% functional and the time is within one second from which I set it to on arrival, month date and snapback day of the week all working just fine. The Ronda 8040N is easily my favorite quartz movement. As for the flash of the finish, yea it's loud and blingy, not everyone can pull it off, but you guys can sort that kinda thing out for yourselves. As for me I love it. This marks my 7th higher end Invicta I've purchased in the last year and a half, all of them Swiss quartz and over that time every single watch is within 5 seconds of what I set it too. The bottom line is that Invicta's design team has been operating at a level of intricacy and making designs that are unrivaled in their beauty and function(when they do function;)har har, and this piece is proof of it. I really wish they would attempt to redeem themselves in the public eye by boosting QC and CS, but until then they will leave customers weary, even people like me who have had nothing but positive experiences and collectors alike can't help but to hope to heck they don't ever need to deal with Invicta's CS for warranty service, but enough of that, they know what needs improvement and as long as I continue to receive quality timepieces I'll remain I customer of Invicta. Pictures included below. JD, PURCHASED FOR MY 6 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES THIS WATCH! SHE WEARS IT ALL THE TIME!, Little on the large side for a women's watch. Keeping good time so far 4 rating due to size, I got this as a gift for my husband, and he loved it. It is a very big heavy watch, with a lot of buttons and features, but still looks very nice when he gets dressed up., The look and feel of the watch are all right. I love the hand-wind functionality. I encourage the maker and other watch makers to design and promote more watches that don't need batteries for the sake of our planet. I could be asked to makers of items that could work with energy coming from a hand winded source., Looks nice, but the ticking is really loud.  Edit: the dial broke off after a few months of use. I don't think I was particularly rough with it..., Gorgeous watch at a reasonable price. Very classy, elegant, and simple. The casing it comes in is also very nice!, Looks and feels like a fake watch, I bought this as a replacement band for a Pebble Time and it works beautifully. It's a perfect match for the watch color and functions exactly as specified. The only minor drawback is with sizing: it's virtually impossible for anyone without the dexterity of an octopus to grasp two tiny screwdrivers and exert enough force to be able to unfasten the links. I ended up using a Swiss army knife blade to prevent one screw from turning and then unscrewing the other with a watchmaker's screwdriver., Delicate and fashion, if the table shows the second hand,then it is perfect., Worst item ever purchased, not even worth a DIME!!! Broke the first time I wore it, fell right off my arm while I was wearing it,, Beautiful watch.  I own several Kenneth Cole watches in different styles, and this is one of my favorites.  The dial is easy to read and while I typically wear reading glasses,  I am able to read the day/date hands without them.  Besides a wedding band, watches are the only &#34;jewelry&#34; that I wear.  This one fills the bill as both an attractive and functional timepiece. The only negative comment I would share, and the reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 relates to the description which indicates that this watch has a &#34;21-jewel, Japanese quartz analog automatic movement, with exhibition case back&#34;.  It is a Japanese quartz movement but does not have an exhibition case back, nor an automatic (self-winding) movement., Just as described....works wonderful...fast delivery as well ., I waited for a long time after placing the order, but in the end it all worth the wait.<br /><br />Very decent quality and packaging, especially considering the reasonable price., This is a fantastically well-made, quality product.  Easily the best watch band I've ever owned!  Except for the fact that when I sweat the band stains my arm . I guess whatever they use to stain the leather didn't set properly or something.  If it wasn't for that, I would have given it five stars.  The black finish had started wearing off the hardware,  but that just gives it charm I think.<br /><br />Update: I bought this watchband on August 16, 2015. I used it for one year and seven months before replacing it. I've changed this review from 3 to 4 stars based on the durability of the band over that time. The hardware held up without fault, aside from the loss of color. Towards the end the leather started showing it's age by cracking and stretching. This is forgivable since this band only cost a surprising $11 at the time. Arm staining continued for a few months before tapering off with no lasting effects. Overall, this was a really great value and I wholeheartedly recommend it to others.<br /><br />(Last three pictures are after 1yr 7mths of use), it broke, I want my money back., I feel that I'm going to ask for a replacement because the glass you can see has some very little bruises which is unnoticeable and the product is very chique and classy., My husband and I got this for our daughter for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it!!  It is so cute and looks even better than the pictures!, But if you want to keep your watch looking like it has original parts, just spring for it.<br />I like the the watch, but the design isn't made for everyday., I have gone through a variety of Casio watches, and by far this is the best one I have ever acquired: Very sturdy, large font to see the time, the buttons on the sides require significant force to apply hence do not get pressed by mistake. The solar charge works very well; you can get it fully charged by placing it out in the bright sun one day (all day), after which just make sure to give it some sun on a regular basis (while wearing)., Just what I wanted!, Really beautiful watch. Big but fits very comfortably. Orange on silver/black a really nice combo., Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you., The watch is fine.  I'm okay with it.  It's pretty much what I expected it to be, but it is NOT red.  The one color I cannot wear it with is red - which I have a lot of in my wardrobe.  The color is more like salmon.  There is pink in it.  Just disappointed in the color, but will keep the watch.  I like the watch., I've been wearing this watch for several months and I love it. It's a great weight and isn't too heavy. The face is striking and easily readable, with the mother of pearl adding a nice touch. I've worn it underwater many times while swimming this summer with no moisture leaking in. The bubble over the date took a bit to get used to, but now I can read the date without issues. Easily adjusted to the correct size for me. The clasp feels secure and I haven't noticed it opening at all. I have noticed a bit of the rose gold finish wearing off where my wrist rests on tabletops, but it's not noticeable to anyone but me. Great watch, would buy again!, Nice watch, however the buckle on the watch band broke when I first tried it on!!, Later on I don't know yet.....but right now it,s amazing and like this watch very much....that's I'm looking for they have date,day and month....., Stopped working about 24 hrs after I got it. Dead battery., Perfectly adequate traditional watch and band with date and handy Indiglo (face lights up with pressing on the knob) feature.<br />Cost is about 2/3 of buying in Target or other retail facility. arrived promptly as promised., Excellent, It looks awesome, but the time changes constantly.  I have to ask my husband to set up the correct time constantly., Not real heavy and the metal makes a kind of thin aluminum sound when it's moved, but it looks nice and for $5, I'd say it's just about perfect., It has already fallen apart!, Honestly, I think this is what a Daniel Wellington should cost...<br />Pros: lightweight (forget it's on) and simplistic (easily matches w/anything).<br />Cons: Thinness of whole piece (makes it look a bit cheap), No second hand (Could be a preference, but also makes it look lifeless mad cheap/broken) It just seems like Made in China is written all over it.<br /><br />Reason to buy: this is the best price out there, and the best part of DW is the easily interchangeable straps, I would suggest buying a couple of 20mm Nato straps to add some variety to this purchase ($5-15). Make sure you get rose gold though., Watch itself it neat, but the rods that hold the band on keep popping off., The colors, ease of use, and style of this watch are great. The size should be good for most people. I am a woman with slim/average sized wrists and wear the watch almost at its tightest. The watch is lightweight and fairly slim.<br />Negatives: The inner Velcro seam was itchy at first, but it doesn't bother me as much after a couple days. Also, the date isn't displayed on the face unless you press start/stop., Exactly as described. Fits the Apple Watch perfectly., it was just what I was looking for, This watch is even better than I'd hoped. Looks amazing and the quality out weighs the value by a great deal. Couldn't be more happier with my purchase. This is my first invicta but can guarantee, won't be my last!, The backlight is not very good. It only lights up the digital section at the bottom of the watch. Other than that, I haven't had any problems with this watch., very think strap, Simple and elegant design for the tightest of budgets. It's plastic so the cover will scuff easily, but a replacement is cheap!, One funky looking watch. Big face. Keeps good time...2 year warrantly., this is really good looking watch and i can give  5 stars just for the look and that it works well..... but there is a big problem with its band.... i just wore it for couple of days and it just teared up......so it deserves 1 star for it.........can not even find a new band to change it..........., Worked as expected and very good quality.<br />It came with spring bars (I did not use them, but it's always good to have a spare)<br />Now, the leather may be a bit stiff at first, but after break in time, it looks and feels very nice!, This is a good watch for people who want something simple -- no alarms, no extra gadgets.  I've only had it a few months, though, so can't say how it will last., The SKX series are classic automatic watches and a great value.  These are the Kalashnikovs of the watch world - iconic styling, robust construction, but not terribly accurate.  Expect it to run +/- 10-20s per day and you won't be disappointed.  It can be regulated for much better accuracy - you can also learn to position the watch at night to make up or lose time as you need.  For me, that's part of the fun of an automatic.  It does not hack or wind if that's important for you.  Fit and finish is excellent in my opinion.  The case in particular is beautiful and you can easily trace it's evolution through an interesting lineage of Seiko divers back to the 60s.  My first (SKXA35) is still going strong after 10 years without ever being serviced (FYI it's marked mov't Malaysia same as the SKX173).  Even the Lumibrite lume and Hardlex crystal are like new.<br />I just bought this one for use as a daily 'beater' that isn't bright yellow.  I also really like the square indices, reminiscent of the old 6105 from my era...  The first watch that arrived had a misaligned chapter ring, bad enough my wife and kids could notice, so back it went.  The second watch is much better but not 100% perfectly aligned and the day/date sit low in the their window.  My wife and kids can't see it and think I'm crazy for insisting - so I kept it (but I know...).  For what it's worth, my old SKXA35 was/is perfect.  I don't know if QC has gone down hill or if I just got lucky on that one.  Anyway,  I do recommend buying 'Fulfilled Through Amazon' so you can take advantage of the easy returns if your particular watch doesn't cut it.<br />I might add that these are thickish watches at 13mm but wear well on smaller wrists.  Lug to lug distance is about 45mm, that's pretty short and I feel a better measure of fit on the wrist than diameter (42mm w/o crown).  I have a 6.25&#34; oval wrist and it feels fine and looks natural.  On a Strapcode oyster bracelet it feels wonderful and looks expensive.  On a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment.a nato strap it looks all business and is ready to get knocked about...<br />I would give this watch 5 stars if not for the QC issues with chapter ring alignment., Its a bad ass watch., VERYYYYY GOOOOOD, Looks good and fits great.  It is thin, so I am not sure how durable it is, but it might be that I am used to the canvas style rather than the nylon.  I like how it looks on my Seiko, and will wear it as soon as I replace the battery (in my watch, the strap does not require one)., Product not as described - bezel is black not gunmetal like the face.  I live overseas and due to postage costs this is too cheap a watch to bother returning, but disappointed I didn't get what I paid for., I have to admit that iI wasn't quite sure I was actually going to get it first of all and that if I did if it was going to work well.<br />I'm  saying this because it was  ridiculous low price for the look that this product can give. surprisingly enough this watch works fine. except for the 24 hr  and montly indicators. they are stationary.  i though the metal part wast going to rust and change color, so far it hasn't .<br />good product for that price., A little small, excellent, Excellent watch and very fast delivery.  Very pleased, This is a very nice watch. I like to use it when I am working in the garden and in the kitchen. I don't have to worry about having to take it off for dirty work., This is my second G shock and it's really a cool one. It's a little more expensive than the main line of Gshocks but it more than makes up for it with its appearance. As others have said here, the colors are not pure orange and blue, but a tad washed out. The Japanese special edition has more vibrant color. I knew this before hand and chose this version as I think the colors stand out enough already to the point where you can't avoid seeing it and to go further would be a little obnoxious. It's big and colorful so it works well in places like dark bars, clubs, or anywhere else at night that isn't very dressy. The yellow roller on the side is a little overpowering on the watch but it adds a little childish character to the watch. It looks like something out of a cartoon or perhaps a nerf produce or a late 80s, early 90s watch. I will wear this over my Rolex when I'm out at night just because the colors can keep. Good buy and will easily last at least a decade like most Gshocks do., Really beautiful......., Took about a month to get here, but it's worth the wait. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and it even glows in the dark :), Very disappointed with this watch, does not work.  I removed the pin and set the time and the hands never moved., Excellent watch! Does all I need it to do. Use the stopwatch often. Also temperature function. All easy to access and fairly easy to operate. Complicated! Just what I wanted for years., Bought this watch for my Fiance birthday and he loved it. The watch looks so much better in person. The leather band is very well made and thick. The watch itself is great., beautiful appearance I bought for my wife's 25th anniversary and it is worth the money, Really nice and sleek looking watch. The style and look is very unique and is very durable. This face of the watch looks very chic. Good value for the price. I have made this my every day watch, i wear it to work, a night on the town or a nice wedding it looks good in every situation. It is a very comfortable fit I would highly recommend this watch to anyone looking for a good quality watch. This is already my second tmbr watch purchase and these watches have not given me any issues. Pick one up, you wont regret it., It's very nice and exactly what I expected. I already had a silver one., Ilike the look and feel of the watch. it is very easy to operate and I love the auto time setting., I absolutely love this watch. I don't like that the battery died a month after I bought it., I absolutely love this watch!! Thankfully there was no physical damage to the watch but it was loose in the box like it had just been put in there with limited care. I was a little disappointed when opening the box but thankfully the watch still had its plastic covering on the face to help protect it.  Overall, I was very pleased with the purchase. It even came in the Fossil tin. :), truly the perfect watch....classic in it's appearance, not too bulky, perfect size., Broke in two weeks, I never have to worry about the time again since its an atomic talking watch. Nice big numbers and it even lights up at night! I'll never want to go back to a regular watch again!, Excelent on time its that they offer. Elgant and finest, The lid of the box doesn't close properly with my Seiko SSC007 in it., Love this watch, very simple and straight forward. nothing to distract you when trying to read time., Not bad, not great. It takes a little getting accustomed to, though I am not a techie wizard. The only thing I would change is the digital display. It is dim until the light is turned on. It reads the temperature accurately and other functions seem to work well. It needs to have time to take it through my routine., very nice watch as I am an ESQ fan having owned a number of ESQ watches in the past... my favorite ESQ's  though have been and still are their Octane line of watches that they have since discontinued.. the Octane snap clasp rubber watchband is better for my needs than this standard band... this is overall a super nice watch though.. nice large numerals that are easily readable..great crystal quality..  still very happy overall with ESQ-Movado watches .. BTW I just purchased a 2nd one thru Amazon today 2/9/2016, Works well, have to say originally,  I could not tell the difference between the band that came on my citizen watch and this one. They have the same look, same thickness. This one was advertised as Leather, and while the back portion seems to be leather, the front (the part that everyone sees) is DEFINITELY NOT LEATHER...BUT VERY CHEAP VINYL. It has cracked and split to the point that after less than six weeks, I have to get another watch band. I have included a picture that shows how the band wore out over this time period and proves that it cannot be leather., Needed a battery operated, reliable alarm clock.  This one is easy to read, the alarm is loud enough to wake me, but not jarring or harsh. There's an easy-to-locate button to light the face if you need to take a look during the night., Its stylish as well as functiones great with quiet mechanism unlike my old Timex. I just wish it had a sweeping second hand option without having to keep the stopwatch feature turned on., Excelent!!!, It just wonderful. Best if you want to give as a gift., This watch looks nice, but it has a nasty tendency to spontaneously stop, because the opening mechanism is at the same location as the time-setting mechanism. I left mine in Philadelphia and didn't feel compelled to go back for it., My watch stopped working almost right away! Gumball machine quality., The Only problem is that the strap band looks inferior and is made of a low quality.<br />I just ordered for a new quality stray band replacement.<br />The band kills the beauty of this time piece., I love this watch!! I wanted something casual but nice and inexpensive. These weekenders take a classic look and make it totally versatile but allowing you to easily switch the bands with different styles/colors. :-), I got this watch because I always see  it posted online with rave reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. I didn't like the band initially, but it has come to grow on me. The watch comes with a ton of functions, I don't think I'll use them all except for the indiglo feature. On thing I was happy about was that this watch doesn't have the loud tick that so many Timex watches suffer from. I was able to snag this on sale, but I wouldn't mind paying full retail for this watch. If you are looking for a stylish daily driver, do yourself a favor and get this watch., fell off apart and i am trying to send it back to company., 10 points. everything was as expected, exactly products, Band fell off after wear it a while, Thought this watch too big for even me, a large watch lover. I think had the watch itself been somewhat thinner  and the band slightly more narrow I would have kept it as it was a beautiful color. As it was, I returned mine the same day I received it. But for those who love really large face watches, this one is great!, The pictures don't really give you an impression of how big it is. THIS THING IS GIANORMOUS!!! Perfect if you want everyone to know that you are wearing a watch. But not really my style., That best buy ever, very comfortable nice fit goes with everything really glad I purchased like it a lot, The product as per the shipping agreement. The watch was packaged well. The only problem was the battery was just about dead. I had to send the watch to Nixon to have the battery replaced., you get what you pay for.  not the best quality.  would not buy again., If you're looking for a stylish and heavy-duty watch with an analog readout, check out Swiss Legends.  This watch has the same look as what you would see on James Bond.  Extremely heavy-duty, but stylish at the same time (no laser beams or decoders included that I know of though).<br /><br />I've had a number of watches, but this one is by far the heaviest I've ever owned (not just heavy duty, but it physically weighs a lot).  So if you like the feeling of knowing you have the watch on your arm, then this is a great option.<br /><br />The readout has a lot of settings.  There are stopwatch capabilities, including lap timer, multiple different time zone readout options, and date.<br /><br />It does take a bit of time (no pun intended) to learn how to use this sophisticated watch.  But once you learn the basics, it is fairly intuitive.<br /><br />Be sure you get the chronograph version (unless you enjoy regularly winding the watch, or you're prepping for an EMC and you want a watch that won't stop working).<br /><br />The only notable downside - the many readouts, and the instruction manual, are tiny.  My eyes are starting to go and I can really only read the &#34;big hand, little hand&#34; parts without the aid of eyeglasses.  Even the date is too tiny for me to read without eyeglasses.  So one star removed because of my aging eyes.<br /><br />Also, unless your wrist exactly fits this watch, you'll likely be taking it to a jeweler to get a link or two removed in order to size it for your wrist (but that's the case with any high-end watch)., this watch so far has been really nice. it fits comfortably, not big and bulky, easy to use perfect for work, this watch performs all the functions I need it to have it perform. It is inexpensive and durable. I'll buy another one when this one breaks., It's just like in the picture but would have appreciated if they offered wrist sizing, Not sure if it's even genuine. This watch can pass 12 two or three times before the date will change., hard to set time, etc. Even with the instructions was unable to set it.  Nice looking though, Love this watch. Face is easy to read and not too big on my wrist. Leather band is beautiful shade of blue and comfortable as well. Thanks for a great value., I like the style and fit but the clasp is installed backwards, it makes it difficult to clasp yourself so you have the have the made in china face outwards instead of Akribos., Looks sharp! The face is a bit big for my liking but my husband loves it and it was a great value for a nice &#34;dress watch&#34;., I've just received this watch 4 days ago and when I press the light buttom it goes like crazy, changing light colors and it doesn't stop.<br />I set the time and just one day after it had 45 minutes behind real time.  So, It definitely has a serious quality problem!<br />So, It's just a waste of money!, This is a cool looking watch without going too far, the stainless steel case is well machined and solid, the offset 10 O'Clock crown is knurled making it easy to grip while adjusting. A Sapphire Crystal is strong preventing scratches much better than mineral glass that you'l find in many watches in this price range.  This watch comes in a shaped ballistic nylon case that zips the clam shell case closed keeping your watch safe when not being worn. The second hand extends the full 12 to 6 O'clock length, half of the second hand is red so its easy to keep track of. The ribbed soft rubber strap is light and comfortable, its shaped at the contact points helping to keep it from rolling around on your wrist. No rubber smell emitting from this strap. The hour and minuet hands have blue/Green luminous markers, they hold a good glow for longer than most showing Oakley cared about the details., I used a push pin to remove links from the band, which was very easy. Light weight overall. You can definitely hear the second hand tick, but this is not a problem for me., She likes the appearances, the fit and the feel time will tell if it's a fantastic watch., i have just received my hilfiger men's watch. it is perfect except that i cannot get instruction anywhere`order no. 701-2002682=7454662  it is a<br />tommy hilfiger men's 1710337.  please. i know that i am no quite in the rightn dept., Very pleased.  Beautiful watch and very fast delivery., Package arrived in time, product is excellent clock is working but a bit bigger than indicated in the picture, overall satisfied with the transaction., I've had itcsbout a month now & like it.  It was just as represented, is attractive and keeping good tome., It's a good watch for the price. The watch band broke already, just popped apart., It stoped working 3 days after arriving..., very very nice finish , fast and easy to adjust !, I got it in a black plastic bag covered in tape. It doesn't tell the time. Its about a half second slow. It confused me for half the day. Also the strap broke as I first put it on. The gem stones instide the watch fell off on that one day I wore it. I guess it makes a good maraca..., works well, it is a bit difficult to program without the manual., I love this watch! It's so unique and I've gotten lots of compliments.<br /><br />Initially after ordering, I got a quick email with a shipping confirmation, and received the watch a few days later. It shipped inside a nifty little suede pouch with a button fastener, and I use it as a place to set my watch on my nightstand.  After I got it the first day and did a quick inspection, the watch was flawless with a really nice rose gold finish. The wood dial is stunning with the tmbr logo very tiny and understated. The crown clicks in and out precisely, and overall the watch feels like precision workmanship.<br /><br />The band is nice supple leather that breathes quite well, even when it's humid outside, and the buckle matches the rose gold watch case perfectly.<br /><br />This is all good news, because I'll probably buy another one. After a week of me wearing it, my wife decided she liked it so much that she claimed it for herself.  She has very tiny wrists, but I have to admit it looks great on her, too., It's prank, the worst item I ever bought from Amazon, I got it for my girlfriend on her birthday and withe two months it turns the colors which made me look like s***, wish I could give lower than one star also., Scrached to easy and if i would have known it was so heavy i would not have bought it., What a gorgeous watch!  I am a nurse and wanted an everyday watch to wear to work with some style.  This is it!  I have received many compliments already!, It's OK,very pretty. It it much too large for me to wear, but would look lovely if you like BIG watches., Exactly as advertised. It's the real deal. My pathfinder has seen some rough days, and the band was about to go. I expected to have problems with the screws, but aside from having to use knives as screwdrivers, the bolts came out and went back in easily, even though they were badly bent. That's the only downside to this product; it doesn't come with the screws, but it said that in the description. But the band is nice and legit. Nicer than my ratty old watch!, I like it!!, Is so cute .love it, Excellent value for this watch, for smaller wrist - best purchase price you could find anywhere, Strap too short and I don't have large wrists.  Loops keep migrating.  Other than that it does it's job albeit &#34;snugly&#34;.  For 12 bucks I'm being too fussy., Magnifique watch very sturdy very high quality 100% recommend use it everyday, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Fits the wrist very well and it's a cool watch.  Does not come with any instructions and it's pretty tough to set., I like this watch. It's got a retro look to it. I have a skinny wrist so the band is on nearly the tightest notch, but that's ok. The face is big but not overwhelming and the numbers are clear. The date is hard to read, but hey, I'm retired, so who cares what the date is!, Excellent replacement/alternate  watch, considering it's not a &#34;high dollar&#34; model.  I bought it as a back up to my other watch of the same type, and I was surprised to see it has a 10 year battery (didn't think that was possible; will see).  Anyway, the five alarms are nice to have, it looks nice; with decent sized numbers for me (eyesight's not what it used to be).  Nice color.  My other is black and silver this is as pictured, black and blue; which is cool, as I like both colors.  Nifty little inexpensive watch to have.  It includes manual, which the Casio Men's AW80D-1AVCB 10-Year Battery Ana-Digi Bracelet Watch did not, reviewed separately., I'm late getting to the party, but after discovering Invicta watches I just can't get enough of them. There is a watch for every situation from dress to casual. After acquiring several of these in a short time, I can honestly say that I have not been let down in style or performance. I don't think I'll ever buy another watch that isn't an Invicta!!!!!, Wear it all the time!, Watch is exactly as it is shown in the picture..would definitely recommend.., Really large on the arm but that's what I wanted - thx!, This is a beautiful watch!, I receive many compliments on this watch once people figure out how to read it.  :0)  I am a lover of interesting, different watches and this fit the bill!  I am loving it!, Bought this as a replacement for my hubby's Casio watch. The original band had broken after 6 years of regular use. Perfect fit, and looks great!, Nice looking watch.  It had a little bit of glue on the face when it arrived but I took that off with some nail polish remover.  I just wish it could be adjusted smaller.  My son's arms are kind of scrawny., I instantly fell in love with this watch when I saw it. There is no doubt this is one of the best bang for buck watches available. Its not like the wanna be brands. Its well made by the people who know watches and it uses its own in house movement which everyone is talking about but ONLY ONE thing disappoint me that is Strap :((.<br />If strap is not a big deal for you as me, and want a good watch which people will admire and most importantly in your heart you know that its an original and genuine product, go for it. Its not about the money its about the value. Cheers. I highly recommend., Works as expected with a canvas band much more comfortable that what I expected.  Easy to read dial.  For $50 this is hard to beat., I really like it!!! I can't say anything bad about it...yet ( I have it for a week ), Excellent..., I got this watch winder in a bad condition (chipped at corners)and the reason; it was not properly packaged but regardless of physical issue the following were my concern too:<br />1- There is an option in the winder that makes the turn clockwise and counter clockwise every few minutes automatically which wasn't working (may be it was because of the not-properly packaged or throwing the package or falling down....)<br />2- On the description in Amazon add, it says glossy wood finish watch winder, so I thought it has a plastic face and glossy wood body, but actually the whole body is made by plastic and it is wood effect not wood finish. I think they should change the add to \\\\\"Glossy Wood effect\\\\\" because it makes confusion.<br /><br />I was not satisfy of the product, so I returned it!, Looks expensive unail you look up close and realize everything is fake., Awesome pc, Whatever.., This watch is just beautiful - not too bling-y because the crystals are tiny, but definitely a step up.  And I do like the tri-color - goes with my favorite pair of earrings!, I don't know what a standard woman's wrist is but this will not fit any wrist larger than 5&#34;.  Very disappointed!, Bought this for my dad. It has a nice large face and easy to read too. It also has a button to light up the face to see it in the dark., After a while (several weeks only) the water vapor starts condensing inside the watch. The watch stops working. Beautiful, but cheap and defective watch. Do not buy it ever!, I bought this as a gift for my daughter and she absolutely loved it.  It is delicate and looks good on her.  She is on the small side and<br />it fit perfectly.  I think this is a nice watch for someone that doesn't like the really big ones that seem to be in style now.  This is a classic and<br />will always look great., I can't give it as a gift because the box is damaged. Very disappointed., Gave this as a gift and she liked it., NOT a Grand Seiko - do not buy at this price.<br /><br />Don't know if the poster realizes is, but the watch pictured is NOT a Grand Seiko., Works as expected, And low cost eliminates worries if lost or damaged., Movement powered. If I take it off for 1 day, I have to reset it. I bought it for special occasions to look nice. After setting it 4 times, I threw it away. Looks pretty. That's all. I will stick with my G Shock., Little knob to change the time wouldn't stay on or turn the hands correctly and knob was lost quickly., I could not get it to work.  The battery would not charge.  Returned it., I've been eyeing some Shinola watches recently but didn't want to drop $600 so I bought this watch, combined it with a light tan leather band (20mm Width Panerai Style Leather Watch Band from JP Leatherworks), and boom, it looks exactly like the $600 watch I've been drooling over. I love the big look of the numbers and the fact that they are luminescent. I've only had it a few weeks so can't comment on its longevity, but in terms of looks, this was perfect for me., Returned because it was so difficult to open the band. Have to put finger under the band to open.<br />Currently own a Guess watch with similar band - push tabs on the side & it springs open., Handsome watch, easy to set, but DH could not read the numbers day or night.  Had to return it., It is to heavy I used couple times and today I wanted to use did NOT Work. Was  a BAD investment  Was a Christmas gift from my wife I keeper I a nice yellow box. And does Not work, This watch face is lovely and a quality piece of jewelry; however, the band is nothing to write home about.  I am glad the price of the watch was low, because I will need to replace the band.  The band where it goes through the pins is just folded over and glued.  I'm afraid that with sweat or very much daily wear, it would come apart and the watch would fall to the floor and possibly break, or worse yet, be lost.<br /><br />Keeping time does not seem to be an issue, and the movement is smooth.  The design is what attracted me to the piece and it is truly lovely.  If you make this purchase, just plan on either not wearing it often, or replacing the band so you can wear it more frequently.<br /><br />I would still recommend this watch at this price point., Watch arrived on time (!) It's comfortable and easy to read. I had what may have been age-related difficulty setting it--crown hard to pull out and the date square is too tiny for me to see. Nevertheless it meets my needs, so I'm happy., The watch broke the first day I wore it., stopped working on batteries after a few  months, It looks wonderful, Everything was going fine, until today.  The watch month dial jumped to Nov. ( it's still Aug ) so therefore, the date is all messed up., The best for your money, Slow shipping, wrong item., AWESOME!!!<br />AMAZING!!!!!<br />The watch is unique at its price. Works well,looks so good on wrist,,I've been receiving compliments every day since I have this. It's a really great deal., I received this watch yesterday.  It is very attractive and classy but the face is pale gold and the minute and the second hands are pale gold so they blend each into the other and you just cannot tell the time.  This is a major fault in this watch.  I am uncertain if its the one I purchased or if its a fault in this type and style., Solid watch, though leather feels a bit fake., metal prong on latch broke off after a couple of days.<br />daughter loves the uniqueness of it and we're looking for a different prong to repair it., This thing is awesome. I'd never had an Invicta watch before, and certainly not one this large.  However, I've had it a few weeks and I've grown very attached to wearing it.  Until now it's only be Fossil and Timex brands for me.  The people I work with noticed it the very first day.  It's a large and in charge watch that also becomes a conversation piece when all else fails.<br /><br />I'd read lots of reviews from watch snobs who said the Invicta brand was cheap and didn't quite have the quality of watches that cost 5-10 times more than this watch.  I took all of that into consideration and I still purchased this watch.  I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I'll be honest here, the reason I went looking for a better watch was because the watch I'd be wearing was so small compared to what my colleagues and management were wearing.  I studied the various sizes closely to make sure what I bought would fit my wrist based on my size and how I usually dress for work.<br /><br />Let me break it down a bit:<br /><br />Me:  5'9&#34;, large guy, 8&#34; wrist (possibly 8.5&#34;).  I wear a watch every day - at work and at home.  I don't dive, but didn't care - I liked the diver watches anyway.<br /><br />Initial impressions:  This watch is nice to look at and definitely catches the eye of others around you.  I'm usually not a &#34;flashy gold&#34; kind of guy but this is just enough to make a statement without looking like you are a rapper.<br /><br />Quality & Feel:  It's heavy compared to my other watches.  Larger, too.  It feels substantial on my wrist but I quickly got used to it being there.  The band is solid and has &#34;Invicta&#34; inscribed on one side and &#34;Grand Diver&#34; on the other.  It also has those porthole diver men on the north/south side of the face.  The crown sticks out a good amount.  The diver dial on the top is solid and clicks as you move it.  It's not flimsy at all - very sturdy.<br /><br />Movement:  I studied this a bit before purchasing.  The one I received had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.  Maybe all the newer models have that same movement - but I did read some articles where Invicta had been using a different movement in it.  Anyway, I like this automatic thing.  I wear the watch almost daily and it stays wound all on it's own.  Also, the underside of the watch has a clear window in it where you can see how it winds itself.  It's very nice and has a yellow part that swings about that has script writing on it.<br /><br />Setting the watch:  This was fairly simple.  I *did* have a problem figuring out how to set the date, but once I read the instructions (duh) it was fairly simple.  To save you time, you just unscrew the crown, pull it out one level (out of two) and dial in the date you want.  One note!!  I was an idiot and didn't pay attention to what time of day it was when I set the date, so I found the thing not changing the date when I expected it to, and then changing midday when I didn't want it to.  Since this watch does not show &#34;AM / PM&#34; , you kind of guess at the time of day when you set it.  Just move the clock forward 12 hours if yours is changing at the wrong time.  You'll figure it out.<br /><br />Sizing:  Ok, so even with an 8-8.5&#34; wrist, I had to remove links.  Ultimately I removed 4 links, but that made the watch a bit too snug for me, so I'll be adding one back in shortly.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this, or any other Grand Diver you happen to like.  I'm happy with it and considering the price point, I felt like it was a good balance between cost, quality, features, and style.eceived had the NH35A Automatic Japanese Movement in it.

It was delivered just when Amazon said it would arrive and he was very pleased with it. The band however proved to be a little too tight as my son has a larger than average wrist.<br /><br />He contacted Seiko's customer service dept. and they quickly mailed him 3 additional links free. Only two were needed, but now he also has a replacement should one ever break.<br /><br />Seiko is a well respected brand, and their customer service reflects that reputation. I wouldn't hesitate to buy one of their products again., The watch stopped. Too late to return to Amazon (past 30 days). Have written to the manufacturer but have not gotten a reply., As expected, This is my third citizen watch, first review. I will be keeping short and simple. There is nothing else you would want on a watch, it has all of the essentials without breaking your wallet. I see people wearing name brand watches that need their batteries replaced, some sub par glass materials, and you have to set the correct date every time the month falls short of 31 days and it's all for about the same price as this beauty. If youre looking for a classy time piece and don't mind the dual tone design this is your watch. You will not be disappointed. I gave it four stars due to the dual tone design,  other than that is a magnificent time piece., Looks a knockout! Dials not easy to read, My watch was one of the ones with very tight back that won't open no matter how many different house tools I try.<br />So I was worried if this little product would really open it, and guess what, it did  the job!, Watch looks great and is a definite eye-catcher except don't plan on getting even a drop of water on it.... ever. I wore it in a light drizzle and somehow moisture got locked inside the display and now the condensation blocks the display and is probably causing damage inside. I will be returning this and probably won't be buying Diesel again. For the price and the claims (water resistant up to 33 feet?) this is not remotely worth it. It's really a shame because this really is a good looking watch., Very nice watch for running because of the large display.  Good for &#34;old guys&#34; whose vision is no longer what it used to be.  😉, A little large, but very pretty, and lots of detail, Can't read the display due to glare. Seems like it's  from the high viz green face cause I have never had this problem on other g shocks., Great watch,however, it just doesn't go with the outfit I originally bought it for. Reason being is, it's a totally &#34;different color&#34; blue. I needed navy blue to go with my fourth of July outfit. Very disappointing. .., Perfect in every way, My son loves his watch.  He has no problems with the band being too small (he is seven and the band is as tight as it will go) and he doesn't have any problem with it itching as some others have mentioned.  The hour and minute hands are labeled which helps him with learning to tell time., If you buy one oil... this should last you for a very very long time., Ok but too thin in width., Much bigger than the pictures make it look, and has a very wide band. So if you like that style I recommend it, cause it is very nice. Had a defect in the side so I'm returning it, I have the same watch in black, brown and red, and was looking forward to adding blue to my collection. However, this watch color is closer to black than blue.  I truly thought it would be a lighter blue than what I received.  I still love the Victorinox product just not the color of this particular watch., Stopped working after a week!, Distinctive, sturdily made clock. Brass numbers and map face can be adjusted to your liking. Easy to read face. Keeps good time., This is my favorite alarm clock., Prefect casual watch. Band a little thinner than it looks but works for what I needed., Love my watch ! Looks good , easy to read and use . Only thing i dont like is i dont understand how to use the alarm and sometimes when im working the buttons hits surfaces and against my wrist and start the stop watch or alarm or changes the time but other than that its perfect ! Yes it is waterproof !, ok, I have purchased every single Blue Angels watch that Citizen has made (including this one) and enjoy the watch's quality, functionality, and US Navy Blue Angels connection. This was the first watch in the line to be radio controlled. It is easy to adjust for international travel and never requires the battery be changed. I find the watch band to be very well made, comfortable, and easy to adjust. I recommend you download a PDF copy of this watch's manual and read it before your purchase. Since my purchase, I bought and mainly wear the newer [[ASIN:B008RNKIV8 Citizen Men's AT8020-54L Blue Angels Stainless Steel Eco-Drive Dress Watch]]. I recommend the newer watch over this one, since it is similarly (or even lower) priced and the movement is more advanced, although it does not have a titanium bracelet.<br /><br />For some reason, I could never get the radio control function of my watch to work until I tried it in Denver, Colorado (where the US Atomic Clock is located). Since then, it has been working perfectly regardless of location. I had previously tried to make it work in Washington, DC, Boston, San Diego, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand without success. I even mailed it to the Citizen Service Center. They tested it, said it was fine, and sent it back to me with a free antenna to use with the watch to amplify the radio controlled signal reception. Since it now works, I don't use the antenna., Works, All I needed was one 25mm spring. Could not find anywhere. Much easier to order and wait for it to arrive. Now have many spares. Good quality., Fast shipping. Accurate product info., I really love these watches. I've been getting so many compliments, and the best part is, they did not cost too much., Buyer beware. This is a Quartz watch not an Automatic. Made in China. Not Swiss made., Many economically-oriented watches on the market are either big, gawdy, blingy, littered with non-functional dials or downright aesthetically unpleasant. The Susenstone Wood Grain watch is none of that. The wood grain watch face is simply but provides a pleasant contrast against the black lettering of the watch. The movement itself is silent and accurate. The crystal surface is clear and free of defects, as is the shiny-brown stainless steel watch body. Straps are made of wood-grained leather though they do come from the factory feeling rather stiff, hence why I have it wrapped around a watch case cushion to help it form a more natural shape. Note the while needles are NOT photoluminiscent and you will not be able to read this watch in the dark, although that hardly seems to matter since this is more of a fashion watch as opposed to a multi-functional watch. I am very pleased to add this watch to my collection at a discount for review!, Perfect fit at an excellent price. You can't go wrong with this band. It fit my GW -500A Casio perfectly., Invictas. Good watches for those who like larger faces., Just purchased this watch. I have the rangeman and frogman and many other casio watches. The mudmaster is the best yet., Great watch strap, only complaint was that there wasn't enough adjustment holes on the band itself my wrist is small, but I was able to make a new hole and now it fits perfectly, the best watch I've owned so far! long lasting battery and the LED time generator is so visible that you can still see it in night time!, Fantastic sport watch used it recently during a climb. I could read the time in the middle of hot sunny day with no problem-I have the black on black model. Easy to program with the instruction booklet. U small wrists and the band fits comfortably not to tight or loose with room to go either way. Would love this even more if it was resin and metal band like a white baby g model I bought a few years ago, but love this one and it's better than I had imagined and comes with a tin case., The watch is great but the belt are to short, I have big hands and it just wont make around my wrist, I need a extra long wrist belt., This was a gift sent to a family member.  I received an acknowledgment of receipt, but not an opinion of whether they liked, or disliked this item.  Sorry I cannot give you a true rating on this item., The watch broke after less then a week of use. Don't buy., The two tone wrist band takes everything away from this item. I had to return this item.., I have only owned for a couple of weeks, so I can't speak to performance quality. Will update if there are any concerns. But, here's so far:<br /><br />Appearance: The design is ***very nice***. Classic lines and dials; the overall look is like a modern twist to a traditional styling - sort of like Kenneth Cole clothing. The buttons are on the left - I've never seen that before. It is very eye-catching, and it is very BIG, but in the gray color (which I have), it's not over-done.<br /><br />Quality: I can't speak for long term performance, but the piece looks and feels like it is excellent, especially for the price. The band is genuine leather, and feels it, while it matches the watch color. Very pleased.<br /><br />Function: mine has kept perfect time so far. The chronograph (stopwatch) actually uses the large second hand, while the actual second hand is the small dial on the left; this is not my preference, but I've had that in a watch before. The numbers are clear and easy to read at a glance. The water resistance is sufficient for anything I plan to do with it on. In other words, splash, etc, but I'd take it off for swimming, showering, etc.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very attractive, easy to read watch., It is OK.  Light is only bright half of the watch., I ordered this watch about a month ago. I like the looks of it and the ability to change the back ground to numerous different colors, the bad thing is the buttons are a little to big, my wrist sweats from the rubber watch band and I don't know how it happened but I just noticed that have already cracked the crystal, right across the middle!, When I got it on my mail box I receive it on a different screen colour. It look nice but it's different than the one I bought, Bought this for my 10 year old son. I have been pleased with the watch., Like the weight and style.  Getting the links changed was a snap with the right repairman., Watch arrived quickly and in perfect condition, was just as advertised. Love the grey and blue color way. Had to return because it was just a little too big on my little wrist. Wish i could find it in a ladies smaller version., Nice looking watch but arrived damaged. Clasp was broken and the second hand was just floating around. Package may have been dropped or mishandled, but either way something you intend to wear daily shouldn't be so fragile. Doesn't seem to be of any real quality. There are many higher quality watches on Amazon around the same price point., I've used them a few times now and it pays to have the right tool for the job.<br />Holding up well., Excellent, Everything works fine now and looks great! It took about 8 hours under my desk lamp to fully charge it but keeps perfect time! Friends at work keep asking where I bought it? I send them to Amazon, Leather belt broke as shown in the paint , two weeks of use, Ok so the watch is really cute but it was smaller than i expected, was going to give to my bf but it seemed better suited for a woman. Not sayin a man couldnt wear it tho, just tryna give an idea about the size. I dont think the face is real wood, and that was a bit of a let down since that's what seemed to make the watch. But i still think its cute so 3 stars, Best watch EVER!, This Is a very beautiful watch., I have been researching Casio rangeman's for two years and this watch fulfills my criteria. The carbon fiber band is light and durable, the watch is somber and somewhat accurate for its functions. I was pleasantly surprised that with Premium Japan's quick delivery, and the packing with the watch. It is more expensive than the base model and my friend is just as satisfied with his base model. This watch suits a particular person criteria more than as general purchase or gift.<br /><br />Like<br />The negative display and other features listed<br /><br />Disliked<br />I can't seem to work out how to set the light to last more than 2 seconds for the display. It is missing some functions from the base model in terms of programming.<br /><br />Overall Happy with my purchase because it suits my needs., Love the watch. But had to return for replacement due to defect. Hour and minute hand are misaligned.  The minute hand must reach the 12 minute mark before the hour hand is on the hour marker. Sounds trivial, but it was so obvious.  Hope to get good replacement.  I will review again. Replacement received.  No hassles.  Works perfectly. 5 Stars., The watch is a gift for my grandson and I haven't opened the box.  I am sure it will be a great gift for him., Great fishing watch for inter-coastal fishing in St. Augustine, FL. I actually set it for Porpoise Point Beach because I fish the jetties across the bay where the tide is VERY VERY swift at incoming and outgoing tides. So, this helps greatly! It is also very rugged, I go fishing offshore almost every Tuesday and for several months was fishing a minimum of twice a week. Plus, I wear it every day because it looks OK and is accurate, I have not had to reset the time since I bought it.<br /><br />I also love the fact that I don't have to change batteries, because my last Casio fishing watch (Pathfinder PAS400B-5V) battery could not be replaced without sending it to the factory...and they couldn't even tell me how much it would cost to replace it until I sent it to the factory!!! Can you believe that rip-off?! AND it may have cost more than the watch! Plus the band broke and the replacement band, once again, would cost more than the watch! (Wow, I just discovered today that the watch I bought for $25.50 now sells for $248!! So, maybe I should get the battery replaced by the factory now and buy a new band! HA!)<br /><br />Anyway, back to this watch...I was concerned about being able to see the dial it in the sunlight and also concerned about it not staying charged indoors...but I was happy to discover that neither of those concerns were a problem. In fact, I press the night light several times a night with no problem at all!<br /><br />Also, I recommend downloading the Instruction guide from online because the one that comes with the watch is so small that I could barely read it. Plus you can search items of interest with the PDF, which makes it muuuuuuch easier to learn how to use it and set it up!!!<br /><br />The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because it does not have the &#34;best fishing times&#34; by showing small fish on it like my last Casio fishing watch (PAS400B-5V).  In fact I searched for days to find a &#34;reasonably priced&#34; fishing watch withall three fishing aids...moon, tide and best fishing times and found none! If anyone finds one at a reasonable price please reply to this and I will buy it! (But, hmmmm I am not actually sure if I can read a reply.)<br /><br />FYI: I also purchased the Casio Men's Casual Sport Watch (W753-1AV) but did not like it because I could not read the tide chart well nor the moon phase especially in sunlight. In fact, I am not even sure the tide chart worked because it never showed the correct tide. Compared to this watch, the W753-1AV is very inferior in my opinion. But oddly, I see it has high ratings by others. (But, that may be because they have not owned both to compare.)<br /><br />Good fishing!, Love this watch! Light weight well illuminated.easy to use..<br />Band is ok but hard to unlatch as the band has a locking tab which seems a bit tough to remove<br />All in all a great watch for the money!, This watch replaced my older Casio, which I had for over ten years.  Nice fit.  I use it for easy of readability and date.  The dual-time is helpful.  I just wish it had a light, like my old one., My husband is very happy with it.  Easy to read., New Variety Watch, Original strap on my Alessi lasted about two years.  This replacement lasted less than six months.  It's cheap and tears easily, especially if moist., EXCELLENT QUALITY WAS THE EXACT REPLACEMENT, I got a few watches that I wear from time to time... Lol but I'm definitely hook on this one., get all kinds of compliments, I received this watch yesterday and automatically I wore it since I had two events to go to. My first impression of this watch,  very elegant and classy design. Love the beautiful color wristband. I was super excited to be wearing my new watch, until I actually went to put it on, too big for a small wrist, it only has 6 holes to adjust size, I needed to make 2 more so it could fit me. As the night went on, I needed to keep sliding down the strap to hold it in place, that unfortunately lead to the strap holder from detaching itself. Other than it being a pretty watch, I really feel the wristband quality is very cheap, but it's definitely one of those items that you get for what you pay type of thing. I received this item at a discounted price for an honest review., My husband loves the big, easy-to-read numbers on this watch. It is his go-to work watch because he can read the face without his glasses. He also has a Timex Ironman multi-lap/memory watch that he uses for running, but this is more ideal for day-to-day use. This is the second one that I have purchased for him in the past 10 years (normal wear-and-tear for him includes a broken band, scratched face and that general worn-out look, so we shopped for a new one and were delighted to find the same version still available). He loves it., All the best to say about this well made watch. Durable, works well and accurately. Very happy with this purchase., Okay, This is a nice watch, for the price. And, the blue face just adds to its appeal. However, the watch band is tight on my wrist, which measures 7 3/4 inches. To solve this problem, I called Armitron and made a complaint about this matter.<br /><br />Armitron's response was that they're going to send three links, for free, to expand the size of this watch band.<br /><br />It's a small inconvenience. But, it's worth it, in my opinion., I've had good experiences with Seiko watches over the years, so when my old (non-Seiko) died, I picked this model both because of its classic looks, its day/date display, and because my interest was piqued by the built-in solar-recharging for the battery, especially since this last feature added little or no cost compared to the direct non-solar competition.  Thus far, I like this watch a lot; it's solid, attractive, massive enough to feel like quality but not so heavy as to be a burden, and its size both suits my wrist and is neither too small to easily read the time nor so large that it catches on or bangs against things. My only complaint would be that my aging eyes would appreciate a larger day/date display, hence the deletion of one star; too often I must squint at it to make out what the day is (is that a 26 or a 28?) It's far too early (only 4 months so far) to judge how much savings there will be in batteries due to the solar charging feature, but if I get at least 5 years out of the original battery, I'll be happy (usually they last one to one and a half years each in non-rechargeable watches)., I have received a lot of compliments with my pocket watch. Would buy again!, very nice looking watch, stylish, thin, the strap is a bit long<br />I wear this watch mostly with business attire, Nice swatch with a crappy plastic strap! I will buy a new strap!, I'm glad I bought this Watch and I'm happy with the price : ), This is a decent tool that (eventually) allowed us to do the necessary repairs on our watches. The space that holds the watch bands is almost large enough to fit most of our watches, although a few of my husband's watches were too wide to fit in the space. It comes with extra replacement bars and pins which was very nice since a couple have already broken. The biggest disappointment was that the first time we used this tool, it broke. It literally just snapped in half. Thankfully we were able to super glue it back together and we haven't had any problems using it since. The glue seems to be holding it together just fine, but it's really not fun to have an item break the first time you use it. So overall, the quality isn't fantastic, but we made it work and have been able to adjust the bands of several watches with it., This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review<br /><br />This is a FANTASTIC watch! I purchased the white one, which seems to be no longer listed, but it came in a sleek black box<br />The leather feels real, with plenty of adjustable notches (it fits me well) and has another loop to thread the excess strap through which I appreciate a LOT (so that the excess strap doesn't get in your way or bent back and forth)<br />It's light, and clearly high quality - simple and stylish and minimalist<br />I've already received several compliments, and it matches everything!<br />You won't regret buying it!, This watch is for extremely small wrists! Unfortunately, I won't be able to wear it., As expected, This is a very solid, well made watch. It comes in a nice box and is very well packaged to protect the watch from damage. The face and band are completely covered in peel off plastic to protect it. The watch is turned off and cannot be turned on until you remove a plastic piece below the middle dial on the right side. After removing the plastic insert the watch immediately began running. The color is a dark charcoal (not quite black I think) -- it has just a hint of metallic in the color keep it from being jet-black. The other ring rotates for time zones.<br /><br />I found the watch to be a bit heavier than I expected from the look. The face piece is about the same as a modern large cellar linked watch like a Samsung, Motorola, or iWatch. The price is such that it is about in the same range as the Motorola 360.<br /><br />It's a nice watch, but I don't think it is as simple as I prefer and the metal band is not as comfortable as a well fitted leather band. That said the steel band will certainly last longer than any leather band. My preference is still the Moto 360 watch which weighs less and obviously has far more features., What a find! I needed to replace a water resistant watch that could not be repaired. Also needed good contrast on face to see w/o glasses. Nice looking, great for swimming , face is size of quarter., came broken in 3 pieces, Fine, Kinda a big face and uncomfortable on my wrist while lifting, Is not working now. Is not the battery cause  I changed it., Scratches easily:(, I have a couple Swiss Legend watches and really like the quality that they put into their products. This watch is a very attractive one with day, date and time zone adjustable and a stopwatch feature. I needed the manual to figure out all the setup, but it worked out just fine and it is running great. This is a very large and heavy watch. That is how I prefer them, but be warned!<br /><br />I prefer metal bands, and this one is a nice one, but I don't like the way it latches. It's not a deal-breaker, but it is not as easy to latch as other watches  I own. It also requires an extremely tiny screwdriver to take out links on the band (this one was a bit too large for my wrist), so that could require a stop to a local jewelry store to have the band adjusted. I tend to feel awkward asking a jewel to adjust a watch I bought online... Otherwise a great watch and one  I will wear regularly., Pretty much as advertised. Bought it to dress up a Timex Weekender and it looks good.  Not a huge fan of the long strap, but, that is the style of these bands., This was perfect for my 9yro, could not get pass shoulders, I was excited to receive this watch. After initial struggles to get Android Wear to recognize this watch, it worked well for two days. Then mysteriously it stopped showing notifications and stopped vibrating. No amount of factory reset and unpairing and re-pairing helped. Finally I returned it. I will wait for a better watch to come along., Excellent and works exactly as stated, Very dainty watch that looks pretty on my small wrist.  The gold is hardly noticeable as you can see mainly silver unless you look closely.  That's not an issue for me as the watch is very pretty and feminine.  It does not look cheap at all.  It feels very light as well and can easily be worn to dress up or down., I have a hard time seeing the screen, the numbers are too light. The buttons are confusing. This would be good for a young kids that just needs a watch. I wanted to use it for running, but since I can't see it well in the sun, no good. Plus I couldn't get the times working right. Miss my old Nike watch that broke., Excellent product as advertised!!, The watch on the photo so orange,real thing is ok., Great value for a very nice watch.Several people thought it was a Rolex. Only minor complaint is band is a little tight on my wrist. It came adjusted all the way out. Still a little tight., This is a fun, inexpensive, waterproof, watch that just works and does more than you expect. For the price, I have no qualms with the quality. Right on the face, you can see the date and day, time, seconds, and whether you have an alarm on. It has a timer mode, backlight button, and is pretty easy to set too. In fact it took me about as long to figure out how to get the instructions out of the watch stand as it did to learn how to work the watch (stupid plastic stand).<br /><br />Pros:<br />-shows  a lot of information in one glance--again day, date, time, pm, seconds, which alarms are on. Then there's a ton of quick stuff available: timer, 2nd timezone, stopwatch, alarm, hourly chime.<br />-easy to work, you press button B (lower left) to cycle through modes: SP (stopwatch), AL (alarm set), TR (countdown timer set), T2 (second timezone). You press the C button (upper right) to start/stop/advance. You hold the A button (upper left) to change things (TR, AL, T2, regular settings). May sound complicated, but after you play around with it for five minutes while staring at the little instructions and cursing for the first two minutes it really does makes sense!<br />-jelly styling is pretty retro cool--the twelve year old in you will love it, but you'll think it's pretty cool too...<br />-wears nice and is comfortable<br />-cheap--doesn't cost much for what feels like a quality device<br />-backlite works well and just lights the information which looks cool<br /><br />cons:<br />-cheap-I would prefer Japanese quartz movement to the Chinese quartz movement that this is, but it keeps time so far which is the point<br />-The watch face is convex and I think it's just plastic which makes me think it's going to get scratched up very easily. I would prefer a convex watch so it's harder to scratch the face<br />-the warranty is kinda a joke. It's a lifetime warranty but you have to pay for the shipping and include a check for $9.95. You might as well buy another watch at the cost of the warranty! But the watch is so cheap, and seems to be well made, that I'm not knocking it at this time. I really wish there was some length of the warranty that you did not need to send the check (if it has issues in the first 90 days you don't have to send the check--but it doesn't work this way). I guess if it breaks quickly, you call Amazon!<br />-battery is pretty easy to replace, but most jewelers will help you too<br /><br />We like it a lot. My wife likes it and is wearing it now. I like it and was impressed with how easy it is to use all of the features. It's pretty rad!cost of the warranty!

I like it and was impressed with how easy it is to use all of the features. It's pretty rad!, Broke the strap on my black one and went buy new pins and seen this watch. Had to have it!, Ok, I have had it some time now.  The crystal still has no scratches.  The watch is incredibly light and durable. I love the watch!, Exactly as promised, NEVER WORKED! Hassled trying to return it. WASTED MY MONEY!, Great watch and seems like a quality build.  However, the screen is not as bright as I had hoped for.  Maybe they didn't design it to be as bright as I would like, or maybe my eyes are not as young as they used to be, although I am only 41.  I wear it at the gym to time the time between sets.  Since the gym is quite brightly lit, the lighting function is of no used.  Bottom line: good quality watch, but the contrast of the numbers to background is too low to be usable for me.  It's like trying to read from one of the early versions of the Kindle.  Just my opinion though.  Hope that helps someone., Don't waste your money, Love this watch! Very easy to read the time,very comfortable and light weight. Got tons of compliments 1st day wearing it!, Very nice looking watch. I would rate it 5 stars except tht the crown extends below the case and catches easily on pants pocket when reaching for keys, change, etc. When withdrawing hand, the crown catches and pulls the stem out, effectively stopping the watch. This stem does seem to pull much more easily than other Fossil watches I own., AS ALWAYS TIMEX COMES THROUGH.  LOOKS GREAT, Right on accurate, MY NURSE WIFE LOVES IT!, Watch works fine. Bought it &#34;used: like new&#34;. However, it arrived damaged.  One of the crystal stones in the band had fallen out. Should be an easy fix at a jewelry repair place, but still is an extra hassle. Band should have 3 stones. Bottom link next to the face only had 2, dial is hard to read and band fell apart after two weeks of use, This Casio Solar-Powered Digital Watch has been around in one form or another since the 1980s and is still one of the best low-cost digital watches on the market ... assuming you aren't a cave dweller who never leaves your basement.<br /><br />As the name suggests, this is a 100% solar-powered digital watch; you never have to buy one of those stupid little watch batteries again. Electrical power comes from a small bank of solar panel cells that feed electrical current to a capacitor inside the watch. The capacitor essentially acts as a battery and as long as you allow the solar panel cells to absorb some light every day the capacitor will stay charged and keep your watch running perfectly.<br /><br />The biggest &#34;problem&#34; with this watch is the unfortunately long initial charge cycle for the capacitor (an unavoidable flaw in having a battery-free design). The capacitor is completely dead when you first remove the watch from the box, and since the digital components require a &#34;relatively&#34; large amount of voltage the capacitor can't keep up with the demand until it is FULLY charged. This means you have to leave the watch out in the sun (with minimal cloud cover or shade) for a full day and then still charge it under a BRIGHT lamp indoors after the sun goes down for a full night before the capacitor has the charge needed to get started.<br /><br />There is a little &#34;sun&#34; icon that appears below the time if the capacitor is running low. Even after the sun icon disappears during the first day of charging you STILL have to leave the watch out to charge (again a full day of sunlight and a full night of bright lamp light at least) for that first charge.<br /><br />After the capacitor has received a full initial charge you won't have to worry about charging it again as long as you spend at least 45-90 minutes outside every day and the solar panel isn't covered by your shirt sleeve. An hour to an hour and a half of sunlight is all this watch needs to keep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night. Granted, even a single low-voltage LED would drain the capacitor VERY quickly and defeat the purpose of having a battery-free watch, but it would have been nice to have a light. I suppose I'm willing to put up with the lack of a light if it means I never have to buy another watch battery and never have to remove the cover from the back of this watch.<br /><br />If a solar-powered and battery-free digital watch sounds like a good idea to you then you'll absolutely love this watch. Just understand how the capacitor works and give it that LENGTHY initial charge it needs.eep running all day and night ... as long as you have given the capacitor a full initial charge.<br /><br />The only other thing I think this watch is missing is a light to allow you to see the time at night.

Just understand how the capacitor works and give it that LENGTHY initial charge it needs., You have to be a scientist or genius to set it. Thank God for kids!, The battery life of this watch has been mentioned so frequently in past reviews for being mediocre or bad but I'm glad to say after a few software updates, the Moto 360 can easily last through a typical day with some to spare. It's not without drawbacks though, to survive the day you will need to use it without the ambient screen on, and that slight delay between raising your wrist up and the screen turning on can be frustrating to some.<br /><br />Having come from a Pebble, not having an always-on display needs some getting used to. While the accelerometer does it's job well in detecting your arm movement to turn on the screen; at times say when you are sitting at a desk and need a quick glance at the time, you'll need to wake the watch up by tapping the screen or pressing the side button - unintuitive.<br /><br />The vibration motor on the Moto 360 is also fairly weak compared to the Pebble, I have missed several notifications because I couldn't feel the vibration. Then again, your experience might vary.<br /><br />Despite being powered by an old TI Omap processor, the watch performs decently with the latest software update. The watch might feel a little sluggish during the first few seconds after turning on the screen but that is definitely not a deal-breaker in my opinion, during normal use it's snappy.<br /><br />Fitness tracking is normal, nothing fancy. However, as mentioned in many other reviews, the heart rate sensor requires you to stay still for it to take a reading, so if you are planning to do some running with HR tracking you will have to look elsewhere. Not having a GPS built-in means you'll need to be tethered to your phone when you go out and hit the road.<br /><br />Overall the Moto 360 is a fairly good buy at $149, considering the LG G Watch R costs twice as much. While it looks pretty, being one of the first Android Wear device means it come with it's own fair share of flaws as well. However, if you can live with these flaws that I've mentioned above (not many), and are looking to buy a smartwatch without breaking the bank, this is a safe bet. It is a beautiful smartwatch that will turn some heads on the street and few might come up to you and ask if that's an Apple Watch.<br /><br />p.s. The successor to the Moto 360 should be announced soon so you might want to think twice before hitting that add to cart button., I start saying sorry for my english. I buy two of this watch. It is sold by amazon UK at 18£. Amazon don't allow to buy this item from USA to Italy. Recently timex change the name of this watch from atlantis100 to one impersonaly end generical: expedition. that is the name of a line of timex product as iroman,ecc... I prefer atlantis100 because this watch is a sequel of a specific and charaterial model that born with this acquatic name. I love the things that have a story and continuity. A univocal name can give a strong identity,specialistic fashion and plus value to a product. Atlanti100 name strengthened the immagin of this watch in sea and acqua sport scope. Dear timex,was it necessary to change name? You prefer call your watches as expediton t1246322,expedition t63515627,ecc...who are? I know that is difficout and expensive to find a fashion name for mass and economical product models,perhaps your experienc reccomended that it have not sense,but if you have one of them that have just a name,please don't cut it. The custom remember and speak of a product if it have a name,identity and continuity.it is more simply to become best sellers. Anyway Timex brand is a consumer and economic watch producer and they build their watchs in a very good quality standard. The watchs is my passion and i like always looking  for them. in my collection i have a lot of watches, somethings of them stay in a very different expensive level like this but atlantis100 deserves attention because has very special and rare tech spec. it is not simply to find a watch so light and slim that have 100m watet resist limit. The dial of atlantis100 is very '80 fashion,has a sport specialistic and &#34;professional&#34; aspect. the color of display changing if you change the looking inclination.it can appear yellow,green,grey...very,very special. In a first look you can think that the watch is small but it is not true.the dimension is guessed for a watch with essential digital dial,basic functionand that don't want clutter. Who want a very &#34;manly&#34; watch look at other models. The rubber strap is ligth, confortable and frendly to fit. The atlantis100 has all foundamental for a watch:hours,minutes,seconds,day,date,month,alarm,illumination(very good),waterproof(good for acqua sport use)....and plus...timer,stop watch and second time zone. Battery has a very good five years life. The timex atlantis100,with his 30g,is a good partener for summer time,sea activity and sports. It knows get look,it knows get hear (beep),without get feel on wirst. it is a little that can follow you everywere. 18£ are a very nice price for a particolar  and reliable watch like this. You can &#34;fall in love&#34; of it., Amazing! Just what I wanted., The watch looks very nice, and the dial has a very clean display, would def recommend., I love my Vestal Brig! The tides are very accurate, and it's got a lot of settings inside that are helpful. I've gotten so many compliments on it!! Couldn't ask for a better watch., Outstanding watch design. Received many compliments.  Looks far more expensive than it was., Yes, The watch is bigger than I expected. However, I like large watches as I'm a tall guy I'm very impressed. The watch gives the classy look of analog and the modern conveniences of a digital watch., I am very happy with this watch. It has what I was looking for., Putting things in context, I have an Apple Watch, Microsoft Band, and 3 MIO Fitness Bands. I'm only mentioning this because, in the price range of the SMARTE, it is decent value within a somewhat narrow universe of buyers.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The One Feature That Makes It Worthwhile to One Subgroup<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Right off the bat, the biggest benefit is that streams notifications -- as long as you have an Android phone. My primary phone is currently a iPhone 6 Plus. But I was able to test this using my old LG G2 and, sure enough, notifications from apps that were able to limp along on Wifi only came through on this watch after I paired.<br /><br />Why is this such a big deal? Well, what gets me paying attention phone are notifications, i.e. text messages, emails and reminders. As has been the case with my Microsoft Band, which I use more than the Apple Watch, because the battery drain is less of a hassle, I can be more selective about the instances in which I'll take my phone out of my pocket because I can see it on my watch.<br /><br />So now, you can that at a low price point, as long as you're on an Android phone.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />The Rest of Story...Not as Quite as Impressive<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />In most other instances, the SMARTE Watch in not in same league of high tier watches such the Apple, Microsofts, and LGs...or even mid-tier smart watches such as the Pebbles, Samsungs, and Jawbones. It has non-HD screen that will seem pretty retro compared with you low resolution compared along-side your phone. When I say retro, I don't mean Game Boy retro, which is viewed as hip in some circles. I mean retro as in Palm Pilot (although in color).<br /><br />Other impressions:<br /><br />♦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is. It's got a nice band with rubber texture. Adjustable too ...I think it fit most wrists. Since it goes into power save mode and your screen is off most of the time people can really tell what it is until you turn the screen on.<br />♦ It's got a touch screen, which allow you access all it's function, such as: time, date, calculator, and pedometer. However, I did not find the touch screen to be as responsive the smart phones have been for the past three years.<br /><br />To be fair, my review is in the context of Android phone uses because of the notifications. iPhone uses should probably not consider it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon does not have rating available, I'll give it four stars.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />∞ PositiveLogicpressions:<br /><br />♦ Upon opening, it has the appearance of being higher-end that it actually is.

However, I did not find the touch screen to be as responsive the smart phones have been for the past three years.<br /><br />To be fair, my review is in the context of Android phone uses because of the notifications. iPhone uses should probably not consider it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars, but since Amazon does not have rating available, I'll give it four stars.<br /><br />Got this at no cost for unbiased review.<br /><br />∞ PositiveLogic, 100% recomendado, It came faster than expected but it had a few scuffs on the face of the watch., Watch the appearance of beautiful, but inside make rough！, I Like it Excellent, Very nice.  The face is actually a bit more gray that I expected, instead of the black it appears to be online.  I had a different version of this same watch for about 10 years, so I opted to stick with it., [[VIDEOID:dae27737f337c776423c7999c6781874]]This BUREI watch is an attractive quartz movement watch. The watch is classy and elegant. It has a stainless steel body and genuine leather band.  The band maximum width 8.25\\\\\" (last hole), if needed additional holes could be made to make it as wide as 8.5\\\\\".<br /><br />The watch's face is 1.5\\\\\" wide and the watch is 3/8\\\\\" thick.<br /><br />This watch is made in China but includes an English manual. The manual covers several watches so you need to match your dial to one in the photo to get the details on how to set various options.<br /><br />The first position of the crown allows to adjust days of the month.<br />The second position of the crown allows to change time.<br />To select the day of the week I need to rotate the time until the right day appears in the display window.  This is a bit time consuming as to go to the next day you need to rotate through 24 hours.  If you miss it you cannot go backwards to you can only go forward.<br /><br />The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing, but cannot be submerged into water.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.<br /><br />This watch is provided by BUREI.<br /><br />Ali Julia review, Perfect, I have this watch, and it is my everyday watch. It's fantastic. Very attractive.<br /><br />Incredibly sturdy-the sapphire crystal is much thicker than in most watches, making it very strong. Part of where it get's is waterproof rating from.<br /><br />One of the best but least appreciated features of this watch is that it almost never needs to be opened. Opening the watch can destroy the water seal, and even a new O-ring may not fully restore it. But since there is no maintenance needed on this watch, and no batteries to replace, it just does not need to be opened. Heck,if it weren't for Daylight Savings Time, you would not even need to loosen the crown!<br /><br />I do put it outside one day a year, in full sun, to make sure it is really charged up. And as others have pointed out, in the dark, the second hand stops, to save energy. In fact, the manual says that if it is in the dark for long enough, and the battery gets low, the hour and minute hands will stop also, but the watch will continue to keep time.<br /><br />I do wish it was a touch larger, but other than that, I know of no other watch I would rather wear. I have an Omega, and a couple of other watches, but this is on my wrist 99% of the time., Looks and feels like PVC. Cheap and nasty., contacted seller about watch ,hour and minutes hands not moving, the second hand advanced around,but the minutes hand of the watch does not move therefore the hour hands does not move which leads to the watch not keeping time....., Outstanding. Get compliments on it for such a cheap watch.  My expensive watches broke or died and this works well. Had one in black but the wrist strap slid broke. I use it in my desk as  desk clock. Love the blue. Wish it was Ravens purple., I love the watch, but disappointed it didn't come with instructions on how to change the date., if it says g-shock, you can't go wrong! this watch is great, nothing bad about it! i have the red trim & orange trim models of this watch. g-shock is all i buy now =), I installed this watch band two weeks ago on the watch I wear every day.  Yesterday I noticed that the band segment with the notches is fraying and appears to be falling apart.  I have purchased replacement bands previously through Amazon for this watch and have not had similar experiences but this one is a defective product., Don't waste your money. The thing fell apart on me while I was on a date. I mean literally fell off of my wrist onto the floor. Can you say embarrassing......and while ur at it CHEAP!!!!!, elegant or classy to look at for the price that is unbelievable...will recommend!, I like the fact of a casual watch that is easy to read.  As plus size, It looks good on my wrist - not to small.  On hot, hot days, the band does not irritate my skin.  Well worth the money!, Decent quality watchband, but definitely very long!  Measure your wrist!, takes a genious to program,which i am not.great looking watch ., It is a very elegant and beautiful watch., I received this product as pictured and advertised.  It was safely packaged and undamaged.  The craftsmanship is nothing but, EXCELLENT.  Wolf have been building these watch boxes since 1834, and their experience with the trade shows on their products.<br /><br />This particular box utilizes a nice thick viewing glass.  The hinges and lock are built solid.  The lock is slightly tight and firm to turn, but gives a good sense of security.  The stitching of the leather around the box is precise.  The black pebble faux leather and the silver textured silk lining looks, feels, and smell so elegant.  There are ample amount of room for my 47mm and 49mm Dive watches as well as ample space between the viewing glass and top of my 13mm Dive watches.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this box knowing it is built to last and it will display my watch collection with style., Tide and compass hard to figure out., Wonderfull, grest piece looks expensive for price., The watch is classy looking and not very heavy. The teal color is not as pronounced as in the picture. It is more to the navy blue side all the same a  good looking watch.<br />The packing  was appalling.  Watch was out of the box and moving  around freely in a very very large  box because they included  it with another item . There was no packing material  at all. I have to wait and see if the watch continues to work. Four star because  of  the poor packing., The watch was a prime day purchase to get started on Christmas shopping, it arrived and I was so very disappointed, it looks so cheap. Really looks like it came from the dollar store., Beautiful looking watch....., Night Back light stopped working after 2 months.<br /><br />I didn't pursue warranty due to low cost.<br /><br />I'm tired of buying this SH!t!!!!!!!!!, Item just as described!!!, I received a balloon instead of the clock Bad never I buy more, It is a not expensive watch for that the quality is more and less, I love the look and feel of this watch....but I've had two and both times the strap pins snapped. My biggest beef Freestyle is you can't just order more straps. You literally have to contact their CS depo, pay $17.00 for the straps, and then another $5 for shipping., I recently purchased this watch as my everyday time piece. Shipping and delivery was fast. The watch is beautiful. I love the gunmetal color. Although it's nothing elaborate, I get plenty of compliments over my watch. I've only had it a few days to a week so i havent had any issues. The only issue I have is that it's a snug fit on my wrist., Works for me and simple to use. Only downside is that I cannot screw in any pieces on the top half - it falls right off. But it's still usable nonetheless. Changing my own watch batteries saves me more money than getting price gouged by local mall jewelers for a task so simple and cheap., Pros<br />• Decent size and weight (actually feels like a solid watch)<br />• Face and chronographs are easy to read (numbers)<br />• Sleek colorway with nice polished chrome accents (noticeable on the wrist)<br />• The buttons on the side of the bezel are non-intrusive (could be worn on either wrist)<br />• Fairly easy to understand, straight forward instructions (nice manual included)<br />• Ample amount of removable links for sizing (could fit varying wrist sizes)<br />• Invicta always have good packaging (sturdy box with soft felt liner)<br /><br />Cons<br />• The color of the band and bezel seem like a cheap coating (chip easily if banged up)<br />• The watch clasp seems cheap, compared the rest of the watch (MSRP $1000)<br />• Curious why there is a date window and date chronograph (seems repetitive)<br />• Ample amount of removable links for smaller wrists, leaves you with one link on each side (could offer more removable links or wider links)<br />• TritNite Night Glow doesn't last that long (even with prolonged sunlight exposure)<br />• Comprehensive manual isn't model specific (general instructions for wide range of models), this its a piece of s*** dont buy the clasp broke the same day i got it!!!!!!!!!!!! i repeat your wasting your time!!!!!!!!, Like it a lot!, It is a very large watch with very large buttons., The band was  loose  upon arrival. Shipped back to company., Excellent,can't say it enough, excellent, price,, It's big.  It's heavy.  It's awesome! The battery works great.  The band was very large and needed to be re-sized, which is very simple using a jeweler's punch.  Love it!, beautiful watch. perfectly classy to wear with anything., I had one of these 15 years ago and it seems like it isn't made now with the same quality as it once was.  I had this watch for 3 days before it broke.  I loved my old camper, but these aren't made the same, I got this watch yesterday and immediately put it on. Have not taken it off since then. It's comfortable, small and practical. It was pretty easy to set up and for $11 I have more I could wish for, even an alarm and light. As a busy mom of two I think this will do the job perfectly. Oh yeah... AND it is waterproof, very important lol!, Cute clock for decoration purposes only. I got my boys each an alarm clock for their separate rooms and they sleep right through the alarm. Then the alarm turns off after a few seconds. I am returning them and getting clocks with louder alarms., Bought this for my son for christmas.  he loved the Batman logo and that it is velcro so it is easy to get off and on.  He also likes that he can learn to read time as it has the hour and minute written on the hands. This way he could not get the wrong time and it helps to know when he is to check in when he is outside.  If your kid is learning to tell time, this is a great watch to have., Got about 1 month out of it before it died, This boy's watch is perfect for that age where kids really want grown-up things, but destroy them in a heartbeat.<br /><br />It has that Otterbox type of nubby, chunky look. Kids that like to figure out settings will really get a kick out of this.<br />Friends have a child on the autism spectrum that loves fussing with multi-function watches, and the grandparents gave him an expensive verion of this watch.<br />He was thrilled, and it engaged him for hours on end.<br />Then, naturally, it broke and of course lost all appeal.<br />This is the perfect watch for kids like my friend's.<br /><br />And remember, tomboy girls love watches like this!<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: Product received to test, with the option to review.

Nonprofits are encouraged to inquire., When working on delicate machines such as watches, it's important to have proper, good quality tools.  This Case Wrench is well made.  High enough quality to keep the repair from damaging the case., While searching for a watch display case, I was looking for three main criteria:<br />1 - get my watches off of my bookshelf and into a nice looking case. Check<br />2 - give myself room for a few additional watches (had 5 at the time of purchase). Check<br />3 - don't spend too much money. Check<br /><br />I was not expecting spectacular quality given the price, but I have to say that I am impressed. The glass was scratch free and clean, the case itself was pristine, and the appearance is as advertised. I like to wear larger watches and this case fits them with no problems., I love this watch!! I have 3 of them in different colors! They are good quality watch faces,  however you might want to get a different band that is a better quality than the one that is on the watch. I get a lot of attention and compliments whenever I where it!, Excellent watch. Had to trial and error to find how to use all features. Couldn't find any kind of instruction anywhere., Excelente!!!, Teenage son purchased for his &#34;swag&#34;. It's very heavy, but he loves it. Fast shipping!, This is a very nice strap. Love the contrasting materials. Super well made, and fits perfect. This is a rugged, sporty looking modern band.. Awesome. I've worn it daily for a couple of months now, on my vintage Wittnauer 2000, and it's holding up perfectly. Surely going to last a long time., this product came broken and when i went to get it fixed nobody could help me, I remember first having this watch when I was around 7. Now that I'm 34 I went onto Amazon and got this same style watch. There is something special about the simplicity of this watch. Now-a-days everything is about the next big thing (Apple watch, android watch, etc. etc), which don't get me wrong, is fine.... But having the reliability of this F-91W on your wrist will go far and beyond what any new wearable can get you. For the price you can't beat it. You'll have a watch that will be maintenance free for more than 5-6 years. Exactly how it should be., This is a very nice watch. I wear watch's instead of bracelets so I have many. The finish on this watch looks really nice sort of like a brushed gold. One thing I like is the little heavier weight of the chain. I did receive this watch at a discount for giving a review but  I really like it., As presented, quick delivery., As a 14 year old who loves to show off, I came across this watch and with about $100 to spend ( 1 day shipping and tax included into that) I decided to purchase this watch. When The Shipment came in the next day, It looked flawless.  The box was perfect and the watch came with everything and even a little more like clothes and a manual.  When I first tried it on,  It wasnt even a close fit.  Unless you are a 280lb 6''4' lumberjack, there is no way this watch is going to fit you without taking out a few links.  I am 5''10' and about 150lbs and it fits perfectly with 1-2 links taken out from each side.  I managed to be able to do this at my house withing like 10 minutes but without the proper experience and equiptment, you probably should take it to a professional to adjust.  After getting the fit, the watch itself looks beautiful.  The 23k gold trim and the blue looks amazing.  Almost exactly like the rolex submariner collection,  but I didnt even buy this to be a copy which is the good thing.  Now every watch has its pros and cons so let me go over those.<br /><br />Pros.<br /><br />Probably the nicest looking watch for under $100 basicly a steal<br /><br />Water resistant up to 200 meters (about 600 feet)<br />you should have no problem taking it to the pool, beach ect.<br /><br />Clasp is nice and gold plating is done nicely<br /><br />Winding and timer feature (manually)<br /><br />Very interesting back of the watch that is transparent<br />so you could see inside<br /><br />This seems a little gimmicky but the glow in the dark feature on this<br />watch is probably the best on any watch.  I am so used to it now.  Just<br />be sure to get it some sunlight or else it wont glow<br /><br />Now with all the pros there are obviously cons.<br /><br />Watch is only gold plated (which is expected for the price) meaning it scratches<br />very easily.<br /><br />Not a self winding watch so it loses I would say about 20-30 seconds a day<br />not a big deal for me but it might be for some people.  I just usually wind it every 2<br />weeks.<br /><br />Very flashy (which is for me a pro) but you might not like that.  I have people approach me from several feet<br />away asking about this watch so if you want to be like a fly on the wall, don't get this.<br /><br />Winding is a little tough but easy after getting used to.<br /><br />For me this watch is a definite buy for someone who wants to make a statement and is looking for an attention seeking watch beacuse trust me, 10s of people will approach you all the time (especially at my age)  It is the nicest watch in this pricepoint but if you are looking for a watch just to tell the time perfectly by the second, then this would not be recomended.  Overall a beautiful watch but it just depends what you like for in a watch<br /><br />Flashy, Pretty, Cool Features= buy<br /><br />Something to tell precise time, not very flashy/not trying to show off= don't buy<br /><br />Overall<br />I would recomemend this watch to about 85% of the people i knowht be for some people.

The face is fairly small, so it looks better if your wrists are a bit thinner. Great for the price., The watch is nice and the price is great.  I just am skeptical because the Timex box it came in was tampered with.  Part of the box was cut out and I wonder why.  I have resubmitted my review because there is now a problem with the watch band.  A pin came out of the band and now the band it detached.  The pin must have come out while wearing the watch and now it cannot be worn without some repair work.  I did not get 3 months use from this watch., Definitely a cheapo version, but it will work., Got the mudman as a replacement for my lost rangeman, this review will contrast the two. I thought the lack of an additional sensor and bells and whistles from the rangeman would impact the watches performance. However, I can say that I prefer this watch because for me the watch face is more readible (less cluttered) and the watch is easier to operate. There are no accidental mode changes from the mode button mashing into my wrist, a common fault I found with the rangeman. As always, the mudman is a fantastic g-shock watch with all the quality you'd expect. Compass and moon phase function without error. For the price I dont think I would pick another watch. Would purchase again., Cheap... It's turning yellow, The watch arrived on time. Looks exactly the same as given in the picture. Ordered this as an anniversary gift for my wife and she absolutely loved the rose gold color and look of the watch on her hand. When compared with similar watches, found this one to be a little costlier. Overall happy with the product., This band's pin to hold it in place of the watch face is too sm to fit the Timex Indiglo watch that I own. It is the wrong size and I need to replace the pin., I like the subtle grey on black military look instead of the loud color models, but that's me. Not intuitive configuration and needed 20 minutes with the manual to set it and understand it. Haven't used a watch in 12+ years but it's a pain to dig out a phone to see the time when a flick of the wrist in a third of a second can tell me. Mineral glass should keep it lasting for years. Auto calendar good until 2099. +/- 30 seconds a month accuracy. Alarm tone is loud enough without being blaring although I doubt it would wake most people. Manual says 10 months of battery assuming 18 hours of display and 6 hours of sleep (it goes to sleep in dark conditions to conserve, light and hitting a button wakes it). ONLY the small digital display lights up so don't think you can use this to walk down a dark hallway. The analog hands are moved by magnetic force so that part of the timekeeping will be affected if you have the watch near magnets and you'll need to re-adjust. It isn't a G-Shock so big impacts or wearing it while using a chainsaw could cause it to malfunction. All in all a great watch to survive daily life if you don't need extra features., Add my name to the list of purchasers who know 1/1/2005 is a Saturday. And that I'm on Easter/NYC time although I live near Chicago., Low quality for the price, i was expecting more from guess, but arrived on time., Very nice watch could be set a little better but overall a plus, Ordered this with the intention of using it on rough work days, and saving my other watches for special occasions. Man was I wrong. This is a beautiful and sporty watch. Shows well, feels excellent, and craftsmanship looks to be solid. Buy this watch. Looks very expensive, however, for the price, your receiving a GEM!!!!!......5 stars., I bought this watch many years ago and I'm still wearing it every day. I love this watch and I get compliments on it often. The solar cell means it never stops provided you wear it every couple of days. Just bought a replacement strap and it feels like a new watch. Simple, elegent, solid, reliable. 10/10 would watch again., The date can be a bit hard to see on my poor old eyes but it keeps perfect time, the band is easy to adjust, and it looks great. Once again delivery from Amazon was prompt and well within its estimate., this watch came yesterday, no box just in a baggy. that being said the clasp was a nightmare to figure out but once I got it, I realized how versatile it is and it's a great buy for the price., Love this watch.  Bought one of these back in '79.  Still working today.  Have over 3000 dives with it.  Started losing a little time lately so decided to buy another., Awsome watch I live big pretty watches so this fits my style, Very nice for business or evening. Good quality. Band runs large, buen producto!!, This is a pretty big watch but it's still cool. My (thin) 10 year old grandson has to put it on the last notch of the band but at least it fits. We've only had it a few days so hope it lasts., First, this is a very light and wearable watch. About the thinnest I could find in a day/date automatic with 200m ISO dive rated watch.<br /><br />Loved the watch until the second time I actually went diving with it (about the 5th time wearing it for less than a day). The diving wasn't the problem, it was after that I unscrewed the crown to adjust seconds (yes, it's a hacking movement, I also like that) and it would not, could not screw back down, no matter what I tried. Had the dive master at the shop try, another customer who had the same problem with a Tag tried. Nada. So it was no longer divable. Worse, I can't even use the watch since without screwing the crown down, there is no seal at all, even humidity would get in there. So for the price I paid and having used it for two dives and maybe five-days of wearing, this has become a monumental fail.<br /><br />Add to the fail: Mido parts (crown, stem, tube needed, according to repairer) are two-months out to get. Nice. I'm heading overseas in a matter of weeks and will be doing underwater research again, so many dive trips. NOT happy. Hopefully with this caveat I'll save others from the same fate (but hope others don't have the same experience!)<br /><br />-------------<br />Edit: Finally got it back &#34;repaired,&#34; saw the watch at the Mido dealer, inside the back it says, &#34;Hong Kong.&#34; They had to explain the case is made in China. Well..., one more dive in Thailand and, you guessed it. Something went amiss inside. Took it to a Mido repair center all the way up in Chiang Mai. They had for a week, all was well. For a few weeks. Just before flying out of Thailand I had the audacity to actually use the watch. BIG mistake. Unscrewing the crown (which had to have a new crown and tube put in, AFTER the Mido dealer in the US put a new crown and tube in - I think they knackered it, actually), the crown just came out, with the stem. Out of the watch. Completely. Great. This is the biggest POS of a &#34;Swiss watch&#34; I've ever own. Timex would be more reliable and for what I paid for this watch and all the repairs for wearing overall less than two-weeks, I could have bought enough Timex's to last me and my entire family ten-generations of time keeping. Anytime I see someone looking at a Mido, I relate this experience. Mido..., rhymes with, Yugo. Remember them, the cars that fell apart while you drove them? Same thing here..., exactly what I wanted, The watch is very comfortable to wear some bands pinch not this one. If you like stretch bands I would purchase this one. Amazon's delivery is wonderful less waiting for purchases., Love this watch!  Easy to set, really comfortable to wear and easy to read., I was very excited when this came in!! I love the size and the fit. The wristband is a little long, but other than that it's great. Super comfy. Love the face size - not too big, not too small. Perfect for work or going out, My husband happily contributes to this addiction and keeps choosing cool watches to add to the collection. I like all kinds, but in the category of giant-faced watches with fun, colorful bands, this is a new favorite of mine. I love ocean-y colors and simple designs. I also love the &#34;Indiglo&#34; feature from Timex. Which is, admittedly, kind of cheesy, but then so am I. Highly recommend this watch., What a cool unique looking watch! Designed in NYC and only a small number were made. This is one of my favorite digital watches and EVERY SINGLE PERSON that sees it asks where I got it from! It's definitely a conversation stater!, The watch itself is nice! The only thing I didn't like were the light that's supposed to illuminate the digital part. I think this was a BAD design by Casio. If they fix the light and actually illuminates from the inside and not from the bottom. This would be one of the best selling watch! I would give the watch design 5 stars. Casio-Please fix the light!, Very cheap, one didn't even work when I received them., Excellent watch, fast service. very happy, Love this watch sooo retro. I was scared of the fit cuz i have small wrists but took it all the way to the last whole and it fits with a swiftness so happy! GO CASIO, Sturdy little no nonsense watch with legible face and nice light-up feature so one can see what time it is in a boring movie.  I have had several of these.  They last about 3 years until the battery runs out, The protection that these screen savers provide is awesome and it was pretty simple to apply (once I actually read the directions lol). I definitely recommend it to anyone with a Neo 2., Very satisfied., Like the watch face easy to read.  Bracelet a little large for average size wrist.  Concerned a out durability of clasp, easy off and on but delicate clasp. Appearance is great, attractive design.  Overall,  good value for cost., Extremely disappointed to receive my watch DOA something wrong with the automatic movement, no matter what I've tried it will not tick. I've purchased an orient ray last year that still works but no luck this time. it's going back to Amazon I guess it's true you get what you pay for., This is a very nice time piece, I actually own a few Armitron Women's watches because there beautiful and well made, can be worn casual, or dressed up a bit and is generally priced very fairly. There is a different style of watch for varying taste. This particular watch is quite nice looking two tone, adjustable links,and water resistant keep good time as has my others. Its a quality watch for a good price and has a versatile look. I like it., Perfect large manly sized watch face (accept no smaller than 50mm!) and manly sized strap. Not as big and crazy like those &#34;gladiator watches&#34; on steroids and not small with a small strap that makes it look like a girls watch. This is what you are looking for. The watch itself is perfectly fine, typical alarm and nightlight features. Nothing special other than large digits if that is also what you are looking for. Great work or sport watch!, :), i like it, I just this watch two days ago. I got it for use when kicking and paragliding.<br /><br />I like it a lot. It's touch and functional.<br /><br />But there are some short comings:<br /><br />1) It's hard to read at low light. The light stays on for three seconds. That's okay for reading the time, but 3 seconds to read the compass, barometer and altimeter... not long enough. Along with the 3 second issue, I really wish that Casio and Timex got together for some sexy time and made one of these with &#34;Indiglow&#34; light tech.<br /><br />2) If you're an adult, it will remove all hair from your wrist... all of it. It's as if the engineers that design the watch spend most of the time and budget figuring out how to turn the band into the most efficient hair removal device ever invented. On a positive note, after only two days of wearing the watch, my wrist is as smooth as a baby's bottom... so smooth!<br /><br />3) The thermometer is supposed to tell you the temperature in the air around you. It does not. It tells you the temperature of your wrist. Removing the watch so as to get a proper temp reading, results in the removal of more hairs off your wrist. Choose your battles carefully.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.<br /><br />I still like the watch and would recommend it to friends., Very cool watch that works incredibly well., I gave it as a gift and just got a call that the battery doesn't work, so I'll be sending it back. Although she liked the watch I'm hesitant to order it again., The best looking and elegant watch...works perfect and its very precise...i recommend this watch...looks more expensive..!, I like this style...I love my watch, I have one in blue too.  Fit ok, even when are<br />big, Thin like a piece of a paper. The leather smells like it's been dipped into a tub with chemicals., Very attractive; reasonably priced; functional, bad, band broke shortly after my son started wearing it., The price is right. It was a smaller face than expected but works fine., This is a fantastic watch for the money! The blue and gold contrast has to be seen in person to be appreciated and the movement window on the back is a neat feature to see all of the gears moving., You get what you pay for. For 20 bucks, i can live with it., If you want the best / highest quality NATO strap - DaLuca is worth the money, excelente, Pretty watch but broke within a month after purchase., I bought this for my daughter Dec. 2014 for christmas. The watch is beautiful she loves it but I have had to put batteries in it twice and this is just August. Cannot find a way to exchange it and it is suppose to have life time warranty. Can anyone help?, A VERY solid and well made watch band, we replaced the rubber one that had become old and brittle and WOW the watch looks amazing with the new one., Perfect for day hikes and everyday use!, Smaller than I was expecting (my mistake, not theirs), but I'm very happy with the purchase.  Numbers are easy to read, which is what I wanted.  Very nice watch., Bought as a gift for my boyfriend he loves it! The only thing is the battery doesn't last for 2 days like I was under the impression before buying it, but its OK it still lasts all day before needing to be changed!, Came quickly. Huuuuge. Bigger and higher than visualized.  Too big for my wrist. Wife and don laughed at me.  I was impressed with the quality and the features, though.  I like it, but cant wear it in short sleeves. Good construction. Bought another watch at the same time for less, on amazon and get compliments on the blue polo watch., Really great! Kind of a cheap metal, but nothing I wasnt expecting for the price. Have it as a gift and he loves it., exactly what I wanted, The watch is awesome, but it came with a dead battery, just what I wanted, Very cheap and low quality item. Only lasted a month before having issues. Clock just stops so you can't rely on it to wake you up. Taking the battery out, wiggling it around, shaking it will make it start up again. But there is no way of telling how long it will run!, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />While I do like the look of this piece overall, I do have a couple complaints. The area where the leather pieces gather at the ends, attaching to the braided part, are white. I would've liked it better if there was a cap or the ends were colored the same so it's not as distracting. Also, the watch part doesn't doesn't stay in the center, it slides down towards the bottom. However, this watch/bracelet is soft and doesn't pinch or have any rough spots. It's not stiff where it's uncomfortable to wear and the charms are firmly attached. The watch is also very quiet, making the ticking sound not annoying at all., Very nice quality and feel.  It's held up for quite awhile.  There's definitely a thickness that you won't find in all watch bands, but I like it very much., This is such a beautiful & well made watch! I got it for myself as I no longer enjoy wearing a watch but am required to by my job to have one. It has a large clean cover that you can get engraved as well. Nice heavy chain as well!, This watch is a nice watch if you want one to beat up. It ticks fine and has the nice Indiglo back light. The proble that this watch has is that it is very easily scratches. I have a gouge on the face of mine that looks like someone dragged a drill across the face. Not sure how it got that way, but I only ever wear it to work (at a bakery). That being said, I have had two of these. The first one I had, the crown fell off. Again, no clue how, just looked at it and it was gone. I was given a replacement by Amazon, but that did not change the quality of the watch. If you're looking for something that looks good and is not over priced, this is a good watch, just don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />Update: This is the last timex watch I will ever buy for more than $30. I used this watch for work and it could not hold up to my working conditions. I work at a gun range and also a bakery. Within one week of working the crystal sported a great gouge in and made it annoying to look at. This watch was also marred by smaller scratches from everyday use which made it look like someone had taken sandpaper to it. I quit wearing it regularly and made it a strictly work only watch. However after two weeks the watch met its end. The &#34;crystal&#34; had shattered and the watch was unreadable, ceasing to function. I didnt notice until I got home at the end of the night that it was in this condition. I didnt remember hitting my wrist hard on anything as I usually do if I smack my watch up against something, fearing that I may have damaged or broken it. But in this case I didnt notice or the actual hit which was the death blow must not have been that hard. The bottom line though is that this watch could not stand up to a couple weeks of normal wear and tear at work. I might pay $20 for this watch again, but certainly not the current (4/18/17) asking price of over $100. This watch has been broken for close to a year now, Im just now reminded of how much of a disappointment it was., I like it, Sizes are right, winds right, all good.  Just make sure you have enough clearance for the adjacent keys to rotate., All what I expected, The Watch is too big... how can I take some of the links off? The watch seems like it will strip, not good. Not happy about my order, Poor quality, I returned it., Nice watch for a boy or lady. Sporty design, and easy to use. Velcro band is better against the ski. When wet and dries quickly., Band broke in Four months time. Paint chipped off inside of band. Very cheap!, This watch is gorgeous! My wife loved the everything, the case it comes in amazing, and the bands are all great. It's on the smaller side which is nice. Pictures do not do this watch justice at all., THESE ARE PROBABLY THE BEST EVERYDAY WATCH, This is such a beautiful, classy watch. It looks so much more expensive. I'm very happy with the watch., Stuhrling watch really looking great, beautiful fabrication, reasonable quality with attractive price $59 !!<br />i'm happy to wear this watch while typing my review on it,<br />good finish bracelet, awesome blue degree but numbers on outer ring not so perfectly printed ,<br />hope to sustain by time,<br />i did not test water resist feature; is it anybody have something to say abt that....?, Thisi is my second orders for the same watches... My daughter saw that I was wearing A black  one  and she felt in love with it!<br />She ask me to order more for her .. A difference of the other reviews on this item.. I'd dint have any problems missing stones or not working watches... So happy with my purchase., They look decent in her wrist being petite and 5ft tall. Large face and bright. She wears it often and likes it., A quality watch, great presentation, superior band and, so far, very accurate.  My only negative comment is that the backlight should be for the whole watch face not just the digital readout.  At night the readout is too small especially for wearers that have reduced close-up vision., 👌👌, With kind of had a kind of it's own. Randomly alarmed even though none was set. Watch was hard to set also., Micheal kors always have great quality...I'm hard on my jewelry but Micheal Kors always stays nice..love the watch will buy it again in yellow gold.., I bought these bands for an Invicta automatic watch.<br />I agree with the reviewer that wrote that these bands look better in person.<br />They are wider and thicker than I anticipated. Very secure and comfortable!<br />What I didn't notice right away is that there are little levers on the bottom side of the bands for installing or detaching these bands.<br />They also look very stylish!<br />These are the nicest bands I have found so far and I wouldn't hesitate to buy them again in the future., This is a worthy investment for my new Samsung Gear 2 Neo.  After receiving my new watch as a birthday gift from my boys, I was too afraid to wear it to work.  Being in retail, I can't avoid scratching and banging the surface of my watches while stocking merchandise.  After applying one of the IQ Shield LiQuidSkins, I can see how many scratches I've already saved my watch from getting.  I've read a few negative reviews regarding a cloudy screen, but mine is crystal clear.  After the first day of use, I had a small bubble on the top of the screen that eventually went away in a day or so.  I reduced a star from my review because there is a small blemish on the top left corner of the shield.  This blemish may have been caused by mishandling, but it was there on day 1 of use so I'm not completely sure how it happened.  Regardless, I still have more shields to replace them as they are worn out, and I will definately buy more in the future to protect my beloved present., I got this one but with red digits.I like it so much I bought the one with blue digits. I have not got it yet but my friend like mine so much he bought one with the blue digits and he loves it.and I think its a great watch and if you like led watches like I like led watches you will loves your too&#62; I highly recomend this watch, little but powerful, Watch did not work!, I'm on my third now after the first two failed. The crown on the first fell off, and water got inside the 2nd which eventually caused it to stop working. The description is confusing because it says water resistant to 99ft which is a conflicting statement. Resistance means it can survive incidental water, but a depth rating implies waterproofness, which it clearly doesn't have. I still haven't found a design I like better, so I'll keep going with them, but wish it were truly waterproof., Disappointed. It won't  keep time  or proper date.  I'm usually completely satisfied from everything out of from Amazon this is the first and only thing I am not. Thank you Amazon. Many blessings, Caroline Romanski, Now I am wishing I had gone with another choice.  This is a big watch, almost two inches across.  It is also heavier than I am used to.  The band is quite large.  I had to take a couple of links out of it.  Whoever said this was easy much have had a different model than the one I received.  I had taken links out of a Casio watch a few years ago, and that one was much easier to remove links than this one.<br /><br />Perhaps I will get used to it.  One thing I appreciate is that this one really looks water resistent.  That may come in handy., Beautiful!!! Good watch for the price. Look exactly as shown in the pics. The only thing is, that &#34;you need to wear it at least 10 hours a day&#34; to keep it running..., Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I own a few battery operated watches and for a couple it pops the back right open. Others would be an ordeal. I guess I need to learn how to get it in the right position. Changing my own watch batteries sure beats going to a mall jeweler and getting price gouged for a task so simple and cheap.<br /><br />Update: I tried to open one of my watch backs (again) with this tool. After trying a dozen times and having the scratches to prove it, tt's just far too fat to fit much of the blade under. I bought another tool and I hope this will do the trick., I love this watch. I bought 2 of them in different colors but my complaint is they are easily broken. I can't expect too much for the price and I have gotten pretty good at fixing my jewelry. So, cute watch at a good price just go easy on it., Huge watch...purchase if your wrist is big., Item arrived on time and was nicely packaged. It actually looks better than the photos and works very well., very beautiful watch, Perfect! &#60;3, I was able to successfully attach it to my Pebble (1st Gen) after removing all 4 links that you can remove. However, this smaller size is still to large for my wrist which I do not like. It is able to move around from the edge of my hand to about 2/5ths of the way down my arm (about 4&#34;). So if you have small writs, I would recommend getting something else., Like everyone else has mentioned, these just aren't quality screwdrivers.  If what you're really using them for is for repairing watches, save up and get Bergeons.  That's not meant to be an elitist statement; these just really don't work.  The bits had already fallen out or fell out soon after they arrived for most of these.  One was missing both set screws, and the others only had one installed, which also meant that the blades don't stay coaxial to the handle.  It's very easy to scratch a watch when one of these decides to drop its blade, and no amount of tightening seems to fix them., Exactly what I needed at an amazing price!, Fantastic Time Piece, Able to use to replace battery in my Casio MTD1073  watch battery. However the chucks, they tend to slip., I'm really happy with this watchband.  I've been wearing a Luminox, supposedly Navy Seal, watch for 20 years and have gone through four or five rubber watchbands. Now, to have something different that's lighter, fits better, and will probably last longer is very satisfying., Gaffer one week of owning this beautiful watch it doesn't keep time properly !<br />Dud, Keeps Time. The buttons on either side don't work.  It's worth the $15., This is a good looking watch in silver with blue hands. It comes in a nice, sleeved gift box which includes a manual.<br />The watch is kinetically powered, and it started running as soon as it was placed on my wrist. It took a little while to figure<br />how to use all the buttons, (and to figure out what they were all for) and to set the time and date, but it wasn't difficult.<br />The closure clasp works easily, and doesn't pinch my skin like the last watch I owned.<br />I found the workmanship of this watch to be high, finishes are nice, and pieces fit together really well. The time stays accurate.<br />I do find the watch to be really huge and very heavy. I understand the current trend for oversized watches, but I prefer smaller, lighter watches, especially when there is the chance of catching the watch on various things at my work or knocking the clasp open. In my view the size is not very practical, but that is, of course, subjective, and dependent on how and where you use your arms., Awesome!, Bought as a gift, it was a gift, Not a bad beginner set, but the packaging was loose when I got it, and the watch opener is too wiggly to be of any use.  That's what I was really in this for, but it just won't open up anything that isn't already easy to open with fingers, and I've scratched a watch or two trying to use this., The watch was not on working condition when I received it and needed a new battery., Beautiful! just as described...shiny, will wear very well over time..:), So this is a beautiful set. The watch itself is gorgeous. Item arrived on time and are as described by the seller... Well for the most part<br /><br />Some of the bands feel soooooo cheap, even cardboard like. Really really thin and somewhat fragile. However I have used half the bands already and even though they feel cheap they don't look it.<br /><br />All in all a great purchase. If you're looking for robust leather bands however this is not for you., a touch of elegance. Clear dial face. supple band. Not gaudy. Just right., I like the look of the watch. Not crazy about the band, planned on replacing it before I bought it. Difficult to see day and date, easy to read time. Good quality for the price I paid., This fit my Timex Expedition perfectly.  My old, original band finally broke and I needed a generally cheap replacement.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I wear the Expedition outside while working on the lawn and getting mucky and dirty, and this band had stood up to that daily abuse., I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift and she loves it. So far every thing is good the watch looks nice and working fine., Handsome, weighty but comfortable., typical Seiko product, good looking, dependable, excellent value., A+, The watch arrived very soon but didn't work at all.  None of the buttons would work and the illumination wouldn't come on.  It was stuck on an alarm setting and power saving mode and wouldn't let me change screens.  Sent it back to Amazon for a replacement because it is a very nice looking watch.  Hopefully the next one works.  Something that I did notice about it though was that the Casio box that it came in was taped up a lot with scotch tape like it had been dropped or damaged in some way., I don't get the great review at all.  I understand it is a cheap watch, but it really looks the part.  Flimsy band and tiny watch face.  For the price it isn't terrible, but I was expecting more based on the reviews., I noticed it stopped about a week ago & just discovered that the return date ended 4 days ago so apparently there's no recourse.  Will not buy watch online from Amazon again.    [...], Easy to read and use. Need it for work. Work graveyard, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  Beautiful watch.  Very heavy and not cheaply made at all.  The band is a very soft leather so it will not bother skin., Truly a beautiful watch. Too bad I wasted it giving it to an ex. He ended up selling it. Wish I would've kept it for myself., One of the prettiest Betty Boop watches I've ever purchased.  Just ordered another watch for my mom.  Would highly recommend this to all Betty Boop  fans., I always wanted to buy this watch and I'm so happy that I eventually did., There are actually a lot of things I like about the watch and a few I don't.  I like a day and date function which this has but the date window is very narrow and makes it a little harder to see for older eyes.  I really like the blue sunray dial, it is a striking color.  The strap isn't bad looking either and is a little stiff right now but I know from experience it will soften up.  The strap is relatively short and will only fit up to a 7 1/2 inch wrist.  The case size is a little smaller than I prefer now having fully embraced the large watch trend, although you can't really call it a trend anymore as many brands are making larger watches now.  The minute and hour hands are little thin and can be a little hard to see, they are a polished metal and the best way to see them is use the reflection from any light source.  The comical detail I referred to is the hour markers have luminescence on them but the minute and hour hands do not, which essentially means putting luminescence on the hour markers served no purpose because you would not be able to see where the minute and hour hands are at night.  This would be a decent starter watch for a young man and is recommended for those that intend it for that., The clock is very beautiful. Thermometer not accurate although there setting. I do not like that the glass is higher than the body so easily scratched., I only wore the watch for a short time, shortly after getting it (around a month of wearing it ) it already showed wearing off of the multi colored band. Obviously the watch wasn't an actual Micheal Kors brand because my friend has the same watch she bought from the Michael Kors store in Destin, Fl. and hers shows no sign of the same wear. We both do the same job and wear them to work. I loved it until it showed these signs of being non-authentic when it was advertised as an actual name brand watch., Time slowly waned and backing fell off much of the time. Tossed in trash after six months., My son lost his other Timex at the beach. This was a replacement that became an upgrade. I love that I didn't need to use the instructions to set it up, it all showed up on the face., Purchased two of these for my twin sons, who have a problem with &#34;bedtime&#34;, and had previously used illuminated alarm clocks as improvised flashlights to stay up surreptitiously reading late into the night.  These fixed that issue, however, they also both broke within a few short months., Worked perfectly, the first time. I read a tip suggesting I pout a little oil or WD-40 on the link pin I wanted to remove. I did this a few days for I used this product. The pin came right out. Great purchase., This is a gorgeous watch.  No other words to describe it., Link band quality is very bad watch looks good., Terrible product. I wasted my money on this it is cheap.You cant remove the links either., Keep it short and simple. This is a must have ABC watch. . If you got the extra dough, grab a Suunto. But the PAG240 does everything I need. I would have worn this thing down range.  Solid., best watch ever, Very big face! Lots of fun. Lots of information. Hard to remember how to use all of the functions, but I keep the manual handy. Not made with women in mind. Do not understand why manufacturers totally ignore women when creating these types of watches., Sweet watch perfect for all purpose watch! Green and black really pop! Hope the pics help this watch is by far my favorite!, I love the watch.  Size is right. The straps are gold quality leather.  Only thing I am not crazy is the weight of the watch itself, it feels fake., I give it two stars for a few reasons<br /><br />First off I am pretty sure I received a defective watch. My reasoning for saying this is because<br /><br />- the bar where the watch latches onto was bent out of place making it extremely difficult to get the watch onto my wrist, and even when I could get it onto my wrist it had trouble staying on.<br />- After a few hours of wear I noticed the watch had stopped telling time. I reset the watch but it will only work for half an hour or so before it just randomly stops. I figure it must just be the battery and it is easily replaceable but I really have to go out and purchase a battery for a brand new watch?<br /><br />I have never had any other problems with a Nixon watch in the past so I figure I must of just received a defective one.<br /><br />But other than that the watch is very nice looking and stylish. The black on black looks sick! But I am still extremely disappointed., Falling apart within weeks of purchase.  All watches have same generic innards, but for exterior to be this cheap, and not worth effort and cost of warranty that was supposed to be free, is really disappointing.  I should have gone with timex., This watch is great, the movement, the case, the band, it all comes together in an attractive and affordable package with a 5 year warranty to boot. I set it to the atomic clock 6 days ago and I am only 1.5 seconds ahead this morning. The craftsmanship and quality of this timepiece far exceeds the price. EcoDrive is an amazing technology.<br /><br />This is a must have every day watch for any collection., Looks really nice. Wrapped really well when I recieved it in the mail. Not as quiet as I would like it to be. But quiet enough. The plexiglass that covers the watches are kind of hard to open. You would need to place your fingernail on the crevice to flip it open. The controls are a little confusing to how to turn off the one you want to turn off, when trying to get one of the watch from the 4. It's still too early for me to rate the motor on this. Hope it will last. Not bad for the price., I wanted a B&R style watch without the price tag, and this is what I got. The band could be a little longer and softer (it's thick and stiff), but it is genuine leather where it counts. The case sounds hollow and thin compared to my Diesels but it's very light for its size. I was hoping the numbers and arms would glow, they don't, so this isn't night friendly. Overall I bought it for style and low cost and it suits the price tag., Thanks great watch and service! Perfect watch, affordable, simple,  durable, water resistant. Put it  on and never take it off for 2-3 years when the band breaks.Though this time the light  doesn't work but small detail since it's hard to find my favorite watch., DOES NOT WORK! Adjustment pins will not stay in the tool when turned upside down to apply to the watch...so therefore TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY, Really cute watch that goes with everything.Is large though but if you need cheater glasses like me then large is the way to go.don't need the glasses to see the face of this watch., While this Timex is a lower end watch, it meets the need of everyday wear when you Don't want to mess up a more expensive timepiece.<br />And, it keeps time accurately., Love the watch, but the battery was dead when I received it. Had to get a new battery on a new watch., It's a great concept, but needs work. It comes with no instructions, the screen sometimes gets this weird fuzzy look and it's hard to figure out how to set or reset the date and time. The band seems like it may pop off due to the connectors being cheap.  It gets 2 stars because it seems durable for runs and outdoor sports. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., Well the watch is cute and it works however the battery has a leak and left a chemical burn on my wrist., These are great straps for the money. I have a few other deBeer watch bands.. Never disappointed. The contrasting white stitching looks pretty sporty on my Harley &#34;FatBoy&#34; watch from 1993.. Perfect match!, Fits well and functions well., this is much bigger than it looks online but i always wanted a sporty analog watch and i really love this..also feels really durable, I really like it with my apple watch, it high quality leather with a nice shiny stainless steel buckle, here is photos with the apple watch., Came with NO INSTRUCTIONS. The picture on amazon shows a blue-ish white light on the watch however, the lights are only red and doesn't change colors. I should've paid more attention to the bad reviews., Fantastic idea but broke after 4 weeks., I bought this watch after being NAUI scuba certified and let me tell you this is my favorite watch ever. The high  Quality  that is put into this watch  really shows it features a screw down crown which can be a little bit difficult to get used to but all you have to do is unscrew the crown and it helps keep the water out whenever it's screwed in this watch is movement powered  using an amazing Japanese Patton and I would never ever ever write a review other than what I am writing due to the fact of the high-quality made by Swiss company that is meant to look just like the Rolex submariner .  Best dive watch I have ever owned would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a dive watch and is unsure five stars  also features one of the best glow in the dark features I have ever seen works just using the light and then it glows very highly so that you can easily see it in the movie theaters or in bed or underwater it that is dark . Comes in a very nice cheese box by Invicta is amazing, only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star is that it didn't come with Manuel to explain how to set it. asides for that one nip pick its amazing so far and will be part of EDC., Awesome Watch!! Great price and looks amazing. Loses about 3-5 seconds a day with normal wear. Try to calibrate it once a month or so., Great watch! In fact, I might need to order another watch because my 7 year old daughter keeps stealing it and wearing it!, One of the nicest synthetic bands I have ever had.  Easy to size.  Hard to find 22mm strap. Very comfortable., excellent quality, easy to read dial, Day, Date and illumination. The Wife is Pleased and that is what Counts!, like it .., Very Cheap, I really like the way it looks, like very sophisticated and its just really nice, perfect for me., Nice watch. Well built. No problem in the shower, pool or sailing the open seas. On par with any 51% Swiss made automatic. The Amphibian was too small for my wrist so my wife took it and it looks absolutely fantastic on her. I will buy other Vostok watches in the future. The only thing I found annoying was the branding. There is none. Some have the &#34;b&#34; Vostok logo while others do not. The graphics vary from watch to watch. These watches would be far more valuable if Vostok developed a consistent branding policy and stuck to it., I like the watch a lot and recommend it.  But you should know that it's often hard to read in low light., Too big for my wrist. Wish they would have posted sizes so I would have realized size before I bought., Simple, functional and attractive. Plus this watch is an excellent value. I do wish that either a push button or fold over clasp was included, but overall I'm very satisfied with this watch., Nice looking watch. Seems to run a bit smaller in length. My other silicon watches have more elasticity to them. Overall, I'm pleased., Simple design.<br />Light.<br />Awesome.<br />Sexy.<br />Buy it now.<br /><br />Reviewed by a Whale., This was a really pretty watch. However, the clasp did not work properly and for the cost of this item, I would have expected it to., Pefect, exactly what I wanted, The watch works, but the band is uncomfortable., Beautiful gifts for the grooms people at my son's wedding. thank you!, This watch replaced a similar Timex that lasted many years.  I expect the same from this one.  I like the easy to read dial and nylon band., Bought this for a friend I owed a favor. Told him 20 years ago I would but him a batman watch if he stopped crying.lol, Slick feels expensive. Awesome for business and perception. Money well worth spend, baaaaaaaaaad, For the money nice watch very accurate to the second over the one week I have had it. Purchased it for a travel watch not wanting to take my expensive watch on the trip., Very easy to wear. Been to the beach still working, I like this watch a lot, largely because it was a gift from my mother.  One thing is that the vendor could have sent a little instruction sheet about how to change the band., Pins are made of the cheapest and softest metal there is.  I can't complain about the cost, but the metal used for the pins could be a little stronger.  One time use as pins not only bend, but break almost immediately., I absolutely love my new watch which is far more beautiful than even pictured.  It is amazing to wear for any event and very dressy looking much more expensive than the cost., The first watch was damaged during shipment. Seller responded immediately to my email (complaint) and offered to send a new one. I love these watches and have one in nearly every color so,I was very disappointed when I received it. I expected to be told to kick rocks when I complained since I paid next to nothing for the watch to begin with. The second watch came within days and was packaged much better and now I have a cool lime green watch in my collection., This watch was a little larger than expected, but once hubby got used to it being larger than his other watches, he LOVES IT. He continues to get compliments on it and loves how a gold watch matches his wedding band. Very sophisticated and a good weight to it. It's easy to see the hands and we would recommend it!, I love this watch! It doesn't come stiff, and fits really well. I have a very small wrist and it fits mine. The shipping was fast and when I opened it I received the dw box as well. Favorite women's watch so far!, Worked really well.  I had to remove a few links from a newly purchased Invicta watch.  Sure, I could go out to the garage and find a nail set and some pliers, but I'd just spent over $100 on a watch and didn't want to scratch it up.  So, I bought this and it made life a lot easier.<br /><br />One critical note:  The piece that lets you set your watch band in it and screw the pin out is very flimsy.  Mine had two plastic pieces on either end that promptly fell right off and I had to glue them back on.  Without those pieces, the whole knob falls apart and can't be used for removing pins.  It was an easy fix, but annoying., This watch is beautiful., Had an older model for years, the band gave out before the watch(still my outdoor work watch) love the upgrades and the efficiency of the solar ring. No better watch for my needs, I like a lot. I recommend it., Very attractive watch. Looks expensive, but isn't., Excellent time piece. Keeps perfect time. Great look. Gets lots of compliments. The only negative is the trijicon is not as bright as I anticipated., It is another typical &#34;Junk Made in China!&#34;! Water gets in freely from front side and back side even when you sweat a little !, has lost time once already. Ok since., I bought this watch for my husband for his birthday. He loves it! It looks way more expensive than it was. He gets compliments on it all the time. It holds time well, as long is you wear it consistently., I own several Android watches and love them all. They keep good time and make quite a statement on your wrist. I like big watches and this one is 40mm square., Fantastic costumer servise..thank you so much., Once again Nautica has a winner. Smart and stylish for the yachtsman. Real watch quality in the case design and the nautical flags are a real nice touch. This watch is a super buy!, Watch is as expected, very good one.. no problems at all Packing was very poor.. got the watch stand broken... either broken during shipping or it was broken when packed, This is a great looking watch. The quality appears to be good, although the appeared to be broke when I found I could not get it to run but I looked at the stem and found I could not pull it out to set it,after looking at 2 or 3 times I was able to see a small piece of plastic wedged under the stem where you set he watch, when I removed this it started to run and was then easy to set also. .My wife just loves it I also got her the Gold one as well . My wife likes to wear a different watch for every day of the week, so finding these watches at Amazon has saved me a bunch of money. I have 3 more coming next month. I hope I have as good luck with them as I had with these. Thank you Amazon for saving this poor boys money for him., Keeps perfect time., Nice but worked exately for 10 months... and now i cannot return it<br />I do not recommend this, Battery is not working when I got it. I had to return it and Amazon sent me a replacement. Unfortunately, after several weeks the battery died again., Just got it and i'm happy with my purchase, it is a beautiful watch, will update with performance in a couple of months, as for now I'll give it 5 stars., The watch looks great, but it runs slow. Once a week I have to set the time cause it is 30- 40 minutes (!) behind. I would give the watch 4 stars but if it isn't measuring time accurately it fails it's purpose., Nice looking automatic watch, it look like it should cost more then what it does., Great watch. Comes in an awesome case. Good idea for an anniversary gift. Every man will love one of these watches., It's the perfect fit for my watch!, For those looking for a more affordable alternative to a designer watch, this looks like a good choice. My daughter wanted a watch that looked like my $6300 ceramic one, and this fit the bill. Since a 15-year-old doesn't need to have that kind of money on her wrist, a look alike for $75 seemed like a good idea. The watch is really beautiful, and the ceramic band and dial remind me very much of my more expensive watch. The bezel turns nicely and the face is very attractive.<br /><br />Now the bad news: To begin with, the crown popped out like it's spring loaded and it won't pop back in. I though it might be a screw down crown, but it's not. It will pop back into place, and then immediately pop back out again. Which means, whenever it's being worn, it will catch on things and pull the crown all the way out and basically stop the watch. I have tried and tried to get that crown to stay in, but no dice. Adjusting the band was also a nightmare. The two piece pins connect in a space so tiny I had to purchase a band adjusting set to fit the pin hole. The crown is really the problem though. I realize it's only a $75 watch, but for that money I expected the crown to stay down!, I got this watch at W..M..t because they did a price match.  All my coworkers have &#34;shock&#34; watches, so I went full lemming.  I've never liked the layout of Casio (because I'm so accustomed to the functions of the timex/ironman), and I don't like the bulkiness and busy face of the G-Shock.  I've had it for a day now, and it's going well.  I am an ironman watch loyalist, and I've only had one lemon in my life.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what it takes to take full advantage for &#34;shock&#34; because my non-shocks seem to take a regular beating with no issue.<br /><br />PRO: It's not overly bulky and it fits my smaller wrist well because it still feels light.<br /><br />CON: I wish it had the same OI as the non-shocks.  I don't understand why I can't have three alarms (it has one), and three time zones (shock capable of two)<br /><br />CON: Unlike the non-shocks, the glass is a bit more raised, which then casts a shadow over the display.  Before I could just glance at my non-shock, but now I have to tilt my wrist.<br /><br />I'm not a watch snob, and I haven't made any investments in watches.  One day I'd like to get a few so that I can pass them down., Susenstone® Elegant Women Girl Watch Rhinestone Quartz OL Ladies Wrist Watch Red: I bought this originally for a friend, but wound up falling in love with it when opening it. It is elegant, arrived early, the gems are sparkly, the band seems durable, the color is the same as promised and it is easy to set the time on. I also enjoy how the numbers are Roman numerals instead of just plain numbers. I'm very happy with this purchase. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., broke within the first 2 min. Still works ok and I was able to do the job but some of the parts are really poor quality., Purchased watch from Jewelry & Watch Exchange. Received watch around /or after April 24 2015.  Haven't worn it much so I did not notice until after 4 months later, the watch had stopped working (  No abuse to it).  Either the watch was old stock and the battery was already and was drained before it was shipped to meor the watch is of bad quality.  I do buy a couple of watches every year but I have never had a watch which last less than 6 years (with battery replacement every 2 or 3 years)..  This watch just died in less than 4 months!!!!  Not sure if it is the seller with old stock or just bad Geneva design. Disappointed that I wasted my money.  Choose a different brand or a different seller since the watch is not returnable after 1 month when I read the warranty on Amazon from non-Amazon sellers.  Very sad., Nice watch. It's much better than I expected and I'm very happy with it. I wear it almost everyday., I have the white one and have wanted to get a black one as well.Love the clean and simple lines of this watch.. Great value as well., Very disappointed in this very cute watch, which  is a really beautiful concept, but a total fail on execution.  I've had many Casio watches and another Baby G and loved them all. The photo for this product is completely misleading.  There is no way you can see the digital windows, although the photo makes it look like you can.  The back light does not light the digital windows.  If you're just looking for a very durable watch, sure, this will work fine.  Casios last forever and keep great time.  But, if like me, you actually need to use the stop watch or alarm functions, forget it.  I read the other reviews about the difficulty in seeing the digital windows, and thought they must be talking about the very minor contrast issues that I experience with my other Baby G.  No, I held the watch under a reading light and still could barely see the digital windows.  Completely unusable for me as an exercise physiologist who monitors exercise and recovery heart rates, and times exercise bouts.  Maybe even more outrageous than this design is the fact that I have to wait for the seller to &#34;approve&#34; my return.  Being that the product did not fit the website description,  you would think that's an automatic return.  Think again.  I gave it two stars because if you don't need to use any of the functions, it's a really cute watch, Very nice, good looking and a quality product. Instructions could be better, but the product is grat, Batteries dead before wearing., This looks like a child-size version of my Fossil Cecile watch, so I bought it for my 3 year old daughter as a look-alike. I knew it could too big for her, but for the very low price, I gave it a try. Unfortunately, it arrived almost shrink wrapped around the latch and I struggled to get the plastic off of it. I must have broken the latch in the process, although it might have arrived that way. I decided not to bother returning it, but threw it away because the broken latch was unsafe., 1. Too thick for s dress watch 2. Not very accurate. 5 minutes gain already on my watch. 3. Inconvenient watch strap. The seagull rodina is a much better one, I have bought this style of watch four times.  The only downside is it's hard to remember how to reset it. Save your instructions, I scanned mine and saved on my computer.  I didn't really NEED this watch, I bought it for the instructions.  Now I can set all three of my watches correctly.  It's durable and water resistant, runs like a TIMEX!, Excelente!!!, I love Timex Weekender watches for the ability to switch watch bands to match just about anything. I own several in different face colors and sizes, and my favorite in both sizes is the grey face. I love that the second hand matches the color of the watch band that comes with it. I think I like the women's size best, but the selection of band colors is more limited. I wish both sizes had more colors in the bands and that they were more readily available., My husband has had 2 of these watches.  Both have quit working within 6 months.  It was guaranteed for 1 year but Timex has you send it back and enclose a $20 check  Not worth returning for the cost., Dial broke after return policy term expired., Loved it!! Perfect watch. It looked just like the picture! I'm super happy with this purchase!, Does everything literature says it does. Setting instructions easy to follow from web download., A very handsome product. The only draw back is the weight. It's kinda heavy, Nice looking watch, however, it took longer than specified in the instructions to get enough of an initial charge for the watch to operate and keep accurate time., Attractive and large enough I can read it, i will to buy again, My god poor quality this item, Looks good, but the works are terribly off time, must constantly adjust it. Might have a watchmaker look at it., Very pleased with the High-Fashion look of this watch.  Price and value is unbeatable., This watch was much better than I anticipated because I'm not the biggest fan of the band style but after readjusting it to fit my wrist it looks great. I wear it semi-regularly, would recommend it if you're interested., What a poor product!  The bezel fell off in the pool, not long after the colored fob on the dial disappeared (I know not where). 40Nine should put its money into a better product, rather than full page advertising in The New York Times., Cheaply made, disappointed., The dial is ok, it is a bit too dark to tell the difference sometimes., Perfect Fit., Cute and lightweight!, It's not A1 quality. In my opinion it is a B minus quality. It's wrist bend is toooo cheap looking. It's 'second' hand has significant slippery issue while setting time. Otherwise, so far, it's working fine. With the issues I metioned. it is not worth the price I paid. I am disappointed about the quality. I was expecting better than that. Will not buy from Sinobi again., The battary watch is speed did, I've worn Timex digital watches for at least 30 years now and have been a devotee of their Triathlon line, but lately I have been unimpressed with them as it seems their quality is slipping.  The last one I had has had issues ranging from the black trim that surrounds the display coming off to it occasionally resetting itself and the display going blank for no apparent reason.  I decided to try Casio instead this time and don't quite have the love for it that I had for the Timex watches of old.  I am liking the five different alarms that can be used, but wish that the chime was louder and lasted longer.  As far as how it is built, it seems fairly rugged and put together well, but time will be the deciding factor on this.  I like the solar charging feature and hope that it works as promised.  So far I've had no issues with that.  My main gripes about it is that I wish the display was bigger and the volume of the alarm.  There is a lot going on as far as display features and other trim pieces, including the photovoltaic cells that circle the display and reduce the usable space, but it seems that Casio could do a better job of reducing the clutter on the display and increasing the size of the digits.  But all this could be attributed to my pushing 60 also, as well as the volume objection.  I have a smaller wrist so went for this watch because of it's size relative to some of the other watches Casio makes.  That was one of the things I liked about the Triathlon watch from Timex, it's size as well as an easy to read display and as alarm that was plenty loud and long.  Last complaint is the light for the display, being the old side illuminating light.  Couple that with the smaller digits and it just isn't up to the readability of the Timex. After all this nit picking I have to say that I still like it though.  The band is more comfortable, the look is good and the functions work well.  Maybe in time after this one wears out I'll go for a different model that is larger tosee if the screen is more readable., The girl I gave it to said She likes it., it came broken, I didn't bother to send it back, thought It was a awesome item, very disappointed, I bought this watch because the mineral crystal was to resist scratches.  The crystal made the watch much thicker than the usual Casio sports chronograph and it proved less resistant to ? use than any, repeat any of my last 4 Casios.  Most of my Casio watches last 6 to 8 years and I go through multiple watch bands during their lifetime.  This watch lasted one year.  It still keeps perfect time but the crystal is so opaque I can't see the time in sunlight.  I have always loved my sports chronographs, never take them off, but this one was not in the ballpark of my others.  I'm 68 and arthritic so it's not like I'm incredibly hard on them either., Arrived on time and is really a nice watch.Large face and easy read numbers and really who doesn't like Mickey Mouse., Battery doesn't last., My go to watch. I love the look and how easy it is to use. However, setting the correct time and date was not easy. The online manual is not very helpful., Compared to a lot watches I own this watch feels cheaply made. I'm used to a much heavier watch but if you're looking for a lightweight watch then you might enjoy this watch., This watch was very carefully packed and in a very nice box. The watch itself is beautiful and unique. 1. The wood is real and it is well polished.  The band is put  together very carefully and it is not scratchy. 3. The color combination and the contrast on the dial are very tastefully done. 4. The label of the company is clearly shown on the watch, however,  it fits with the design--not as an &#34;in your face logo.&#34; I don't like when the logo takes over the product. 5. The clasp is easy to open and to close. Push on the side buttons to open it or to close it on your hand. 6. The band is fairly wide and comfortable. The dial is very easy to read and no detail is out of place. It's a joy to look at the  watch, instead of the ubiquitous &#34;clock app&#34; on a smart phone. :=) I am very impressed with this company. I've always received clear and prompt responses to my questions; the few items I bought were always carefully packed and clearly inspected.  I hope that the company will continue its tradition in providing outstanding unique products and service. I found a few things for my wishlist already. :) I really enjoy wearing this watch., I'm disappointed with it's appearance of the coatings, and lack of any illumination of, the face or hands! I rashly threw away the box. Before I thoroughly inspected the product! So that's my fault!, Yes, the band on this thing sucks, cheap leather, I needed to replace a silver watch that I lost. This one was a bright and shiny silver watch that was attractive in its simplicity. When I received it, the face was a little larger than I wanted, but I quickly adjusted to it. The band was a little stiff, so it didn't move with my wrist as well as I would have liked, but I adjusted to that also. I only wore the watch about five or six times. One time the watch fell from my wrist onto the ground, and I assumed I had not properly snapped the clasp. I made sure the clasp was closed tightly and wore the watch the rest of the day without incident. Another time it fell off my wrist but landed in my lap. Again I think I did not snap the clasp hard enough. I vowed to always double check the clasp, but started to wish the watch had a protective chain, so it couldn't fall off my wrist. One day, I wanted to protect the watch from getting scratched while I was doing something,  so I removed it and put it into a QUILTED pouch in my purse all by itself.  When I later took it out to wear it, I found that the pin had fallen out so one side of the band had separated from the watch. Now this watch that I wore only a handful of times needs repair. And even if I spent the money to fix it, I fear the pin will fall out again. When I attempted to return it, I was informed it was too late to do so., Excellent product, I really recommend it!, I love the watch but thankfully I have big hands and wrists because the watch is a pretty big watch but it's a great watch, Wasn't  too thrilled, couldn't figure  how to set time. I followed instructions but was not successful. So nestles to say the kid isn't  using it. Have to figure  out another time., A birthday gift for my oldest daughter.  She has quite the Invicta collection, thanks to me.  This one is a little more traditional and girly.  She loves it and if she's happy then I'm happy., I really liked the design, but the time gets wrong if not used the watch for a long time.<br />I have many watches, and when I try to use this watch after leaving it one month,<br />The time is always not correct., It looks nice, just like the pictures, but none of the three smaller dials works.  The minute, hour, and second hands all work which is all I need, so I'll keep it, but I can't give it more stars because it doesn't work how it says it should., As a nursing student, this product is perfect for my needs.  It fits beautifully, and has the second hand that is necessary for taking vitals on my clinical patients. A digital watch would not work for my needs as I need the second hand. I love that it is stylish as well.  Cute colors in the face, while white to fit the requirements of my school uniform, great looking band....originally thought it was going to have a gold buckle as seen in the picture but it came with silver...however the seller did send me a gold one andI am very happy...THANK YOU, Perfect for my 90-year old mom.  The numbers are easy for her to see., It's perfect! Fits right and has no damage, I bought this as a gift for someone who is really petite. The watch is REALLY heavy but you can tell it's crafted well. But had to send back cause it would have been too heavy and too big for the person. I didn't want to keep it cause I thought it would be too heavy for me. Maybe better for a man than a woman., It's not A1 quality. It's okay for the price., I bought this for my daughter who just started running on her HS cross country team.  She likes the style and it is very easy to use.  Nice product., Impeccable function and looks along with accuracy. Haven't bought this watch from amazon but this piece comes highly recommended. The hands may look out of place being coated white and not steel or glossy and maybe an initial let down. Fits as a right size on medium sized hands and looks bigger than its 40mm., Didn't give this purchase enough forethought, and it is somewhat uncomfortable., I purchased the GA100-1a1 because I needed a nice rugged watch which was also stylish with good features. After reading reviews and checking out videos and pictures, I picked this one up. Im really happy with the purchase. It looks great with its sleek flat black band and black designed face. Comes in a nice gshock tin can that could be used for other purposes.<br /><br />The manual is easy to use with clear instructions and has various languages. The two digital areas on the left bottom and right bottom of the face can hold different information such as lap time, day/date, seconds, world time, &#34;home time&#34; and other various options. Its comfortable to wear and shock / water proof.<br /><br />There are a few things I personally wish were different. The hour and minute hand is not irridecent or illuminating at all. It appears as it should be. The illuminating face light is pretty dim and its a yellowish color. A bright white led would have been a better option. I kind of wish there was a second hand, but theres a digital seconds option for the bottom right digital area. Sometimes the hands can block it so its not visible. These are more-so personal options of what I would like, and not a flaw of the watch.<br /><br />Overall great watch for the price!, Seems to be a bit stiffer than the original band that came with my<br />SKX171 dive watch (not seikos best by any means) but is holding up<br />well.  No cracking or splitting so far., Very elegant and beautiful watch. It is simply worth the price., Excellent strap for the price, however, the pins that come with the strap are somewhat inferior. They kept popping off which lend me to replace the pins with stronger ones., I bought this to replace an extremely similar watch with a plastic strap that had died after years of constant use. This one doesn't need to be washed as often as the plastic, which smelled sweaty and weird every few months.<br /><br />I find it weirdly comforting to carry one electronic device that cannot malfunction due to programming or the Internet. Unlike some friends of mine with watches that cost hundreds of dollars, my watch always tells the time. It never says &#34;The device has stopped responding, please reboot&#34; or any other error message., It was a birthday gift for my son who is an executive . Suit, tie, and watches are his everyday attire. The packaging of the watch was classy and sturdy befitting the watch itself. The watch had weight and a high standard appearance. I would purchase another Stuhrling watch any day., My husband bought this for me as a gift before starting my internship.  It's a nice watch and the opal finish on the face is beautiful.  I have small wrists and generally like smaller/slender bracelets and watches.  This one fits nicely, not too bulky and easy to read., A very beautiful watch. I carry it always, you need wind it each day but very handy if you need keep track of time. I tend to use up my cellphones battery often so this is a handy time piece., I like this little alarm clock. Got it right next to my bed., Been battle testing it offshore. No problems a little complicated so I need to read manual more. Over all very tough if you work in the offshore industry highly recommend as the alarm is actually a good strength. It is a big watch and so you will need to get used to this., Have had the watch about 3 years...watch still works great albeit a little scratched up...description claims mineral crystal display in one place and plastic in another, like to know which. Band has failed and it seems to make more sense to replace the watch than replace the band. I don't think the vast majority of owners ever run out of battery life., excelente, I bought this watch due some issues with other brands where water proof was not really water proof, this watch works perfectly., The watch face is gigantic and heavy.  It is definitely made for a man.  Have to return it because the huge size makes it very uncomfortable and unwieldy.  Hard to use a computer keyboard.  Too bad.  It looks really attractive in the photo, but the women's model is no smaller than the unisex., Good simple watch. Would like it better if the side buttons were recessed so they wouldn't get pushed by objects I am handling, It's a great concept, but needs work. It comes with no instructions, the screen sometimes gets this weird fuzzy look and it's hard to figure out how to set or reset the date and time. The band seems like it may pop off due to the connectors being cheap.  It gets 2 stars because it seems durable for runs and outdoor sports. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review., used to replace battery on water resistant watch - worked easily the 1st time used and highly recommended if you want to replace your own batteries, For a watch it is good like all Timex watches. However the watch I received from Amazon is not the one pictured here which has a medium brown and and nearly white markers and hands. The combination in the picture is very sharp looking it is not what was delivered. What I received was a different color combination of much lighter color brown band and pale yellow hands which has much less visual impact. The one I actually got is OK but does not look like the one in the picture. If it had looked as it was presented I would have given it two additional stars., Nice watch, but I returned it because it is huge.  The pictures don't depict how big this watch is., The watch is more yellow color than I would have liked but it fits well and works. It did not look like the picture in my opinion which was a lighter gold color.  I have since purchased another slim style gold watch that I prefer to wear instead of this one.  It is still a nice watch just a bit off in color for my taste anyway., 😍😍😍😍😍, I have only 3 negative comments. 1.  The manual is printed in almost unreadable tiny print.  2.  To use all of it's functions you would have to spend 2 hours reading the manual.  3. I worry that it won't get sufficient light to keep it charged.<br />Otherwise it works fine and looks good., This watch is very easy for children to read and the strap on it is easily adjusted. My daughter loves it., I bought this watch mainly for the dial. I didn't really like the band so when I ordered I checked the width and ordered another one the same size. Imagine my surprise when I received both items when the band in fact is 22 mm, instead of the 23 stated in the specifications.  I would highly recommend being as accurate as possible when it comes to the information of the products you are selling, now I'm stuck with a watch that only like the dial, and bands with no watch to use with.  I'm not really happy, where's my money??!, Really like the look and function. Good value., Bought this for my daughter for christmas.  she loves Frozen, as all girls. She also loved that it is velcro so it is easy to get off and on.  She also likes that she can learn to read time as it has the hour and minute written on the hands. This way she could not get the wrong time and it helps to know when she is to check in when he is outside.  If your kid is learning to tell time, this is a great watch to have., excellent watch with excellent service, Splendid watch.  Looks much more sumptuous in-person than in the picture.  Check online auctions for lower prices., This Invicta watch is a sporty stand out.  It fits my slender wrist well, works well and looks good.  The time and date are easy to set, unlike some Invictas, which can be a challenge.  Love it!, Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended., Attractive but hard to read hands as they are the same color as the gearing. Needs to either be worn every day or put on a winder because it has no ability to go without movement for more than a day., Easy to see.<br /><br /> Also, red and blue lighted dial. Loud alarm., The band lasted maybe 7 months before it broke in two places.  I expect a lot more for something of this price and supposed quality.  I've gotten more from products of much lower cost., The outer ring with the numbers on it is made of really flimsy plastic. The watch face is made of plastic too. With an active kid it would probably be scratched in no time and the band is just a thin strip of fabric. I like the concept of the watch but the execution is poorly done., very beautiful watch, Not worth it .. it's just a dark screen protector it doesn't add any Privacy..  I took it off right away, For the money ($52.62), this is a delightful watch.  The size is right, the heft is right, the finishes are sophisticated and clean, it's comfortable; all in all, a great addition to the collection.  I removed five of the six links with pins and the fit, thanks to the micro adjustments on the clasp, is perfect (very easy to size at home).  The legibility in bright light is not bad.  Black hands on a black face is not the best combo, but the white luminous inserts on the hands help a bit.  I like the screw-down crown as well.<br /><br />Downside?  The numerals and markers are not luminous.  My bad for not reading thoroughly, but it makes the watch almost impossible to read in low light or darkness.  That's a feature I rely on in a workhorse watch, so this is relegated to occasional duty.  The other issue is the internal rotating bezel.  I love the feature, but it isn't locked or ratcheted, so it is easily displaced by normal movement, and, therefore, useless.<br /><br />I like it.  At that price I really like it.  But it's so close to being so much more!, As described. Nice, cheap way to change the look of my watch..., Love it! The transparent inner ring makes the clock look as if it was custom colored for my office; blends in wonderfully! Suspect this would work with virtually any wall color.  Plus, constant second hand sweep; no ticking., I bought this for my husband, at first I didn't like it and was worried he wouldn't either. It seemed so huge and excessive with the gold finish. But after looking at it again I really like it now. It fits well on my husband's wrist - not too big at all - and he is very pleased too.., I bought this watch for my exercise purpose, since I am an outdoor exercise lover.  My dripping sweat could do nothing to this watch.  It is also attractive., Round design and plastic materials are ugly, squeaked, and broke after a year. Did the job for the time being but i am happy and not surprised i'm replacing it., Formy dad, Really nice looking watch.  The atomic auto set function works great.  No setting and time is always correct., Very attractive watch which people notice and comment positively about. I bought it to keep track time at home on my recent trip to Asia. Per Murphy's Law, of course, China, Taiwan and Singapore are currently all 12 hours from the East Coast so it was kind of superfluous. But still cool and there will be other time zones. I was not sure whether this was a wound or battery watch until I got it. Both movements are battery driven and seem to work well. Band is OK quality but in line with cost. Overall worth the price., Super cute bracelet but the straps are too long., Very classy and expensive looking. These pics don't really do it justice. I  was going to buy a couple of other designer  watches to add to my collection. I have an Armani watch that I love dearly, a silver And platinum Rolex that is a gift from my father, but this watch is clearly now my favorite watch. As a matter of fact, I will not be buying anymore watches for now. I brought a brown, a white and yellow  bands to switch things up a bit. . It feels  now  like I have several expensive watches.The silver face goes with any color band to match your outfit. I saved a ton of money  just buy buying different bands and a spring bar tool to change these bands in less than 10 secs. Love it, I loved the look of the watch. It was exactly what I had been searching for for quite some time. The speed of delivery was fast so no complaints there. And the return to Amazon was so fast and efficient it left my head spinning, what a professional outfit.<br /><br />All that being said, I was SO VERY DISAPPOINTED in this watch. It is the first watch in my life (over 65) that when I went to set the time the stem pulled completely out of the watch!  Talk about being shocked! I stuck the stem back into the watch but of course nothing worked. I was heartbroken. I was tempted to make this a one star rating but I don't hate the watch and I still wish it had worked but to be honest I am now gun shy about buying another. And that saddens me,, I never wore watches because they would feel to tight or my wrist or just look odd but I decided to try it again and thought I would get a cheaper watch first. I love this watch, it's not too tight, it looks fabulous, and it can really take a beating! I am not a gentle person and this watch has not yet scratched and I've worn it every day for three plus weeks so far! Someone I know who has a $100 arch has scratches all over theirs and is jealous of mine! If you want a classy watch that will get you compliments every day you wear it get this one!, Bday gift for my son.  He likes it..hopefully its durable enough for military life., My wrists are extremely small so I had to bore some additional holes for the band to fit.  In addition the face of the watch does seem a bit large on my small wrists, but that adds to the funkiness and unusual design of this watch., This watch looks gorgeus. A bit heavy, but not more than more traditional watches of this size. Mechanism is silent. Built quality is more than enough for its price. Color is bright light cupper, a bit similar to golden, but not (it's more discrete). Beware: this model is the only one without luminiscent effect in the dark, from the Eclipse serie., This watch is the biggest single piece of garbage ever produced. The chronograph quit funcioning about a month after I purchased this watch and they want $36.00 to repair a watch under warranty. Do not buy this!, Attractive watch.  Do wish it had more than one alarm., Got watch for my grandson. He is enjoying it., I was looking  for a watch with a large diameter face. Not something crazy like some of those you see that look like they are on steroids, but a manly size face with a manly sized strap (typical ones seem to have a small face and strap so it seems more like a girls watch). So I came to learn that I am looking for 50mm diameter size in the description to satisfy my 'look'. As far a the watch itself, yeah, standard digital watch with alarms and face light up at night features. It's the look that sold me., a, Functional and of fine quality.  Includes numerous tips suitable for opening everything.  A must have for checking movements prior to purchasing high end antique timepieces as well as for replacing batteries in the children's department store watches., I really don't understand.... I need more information how set time arlam ... It really didn't come with good instructions., [[ASIN:B00S0D9J74 Bessky® Luxury Fashion Crocodile Faux Leather Mens Analog Watch Watches]] In reality it looks inferior than what it looks in the picture. But what am I complaining about. I only paid $3.60. So what the hack, I give it four stars., Tough and attractive. Keeps excellent time.  Saphire crystal hasn't been scratched in 2 years.  Alarm is very audible unless you have lost your high-frequency hearing., I wanted a larger dial, but not a man's watch. I love the idea of the solar battery, and it is keeping perfect time. It is a terrific buy; just check Seiko's website., Watch is really well built. It fit fits and feels great. You can't beat the price for the quality., This was actually a gift for one of my good friends- the look on her face when she opened it was priceless!, This watch is exceptionally  light, color blue is very  bright . The size is perfect. Nice looking.  Fun piece., Couldn't be happier with it!  Color was exactly what I wanted., Arrived on time and works as promised. Note that it mostly works at night rather than during the day so do not be surprised at the lack of activity during the day. It does not want to over-wind the watches., Wife loves it, therefore makes a hero out of me. Thank You Seiko and Amazon., I Love the watch the color, band the look the way it fits the Invicta is a watch tha i will be buying for<br />myself and my family, THANK INVICTA great price SEE YOU SOON!!!!, I have purchased every single Blue Angels watch that Citizen has made (including this one) and enjoy the watch's quality, functionality, and US Navy Blue Angels connection. This was the first watch in the line to be radio controlled. It is easy to adjust for international travel and never requires the battery be changed. I find the watch's bracelet to be very well made, comfortable, easy to adjust, but a little bit heavy. Citizen sells this watch with a lighter titanium bracelet: [[ASIN:B001QFYKTA Citizen Men's JY0050-55L Blue Angels Skyhawk A-T Titanium Eco-Drive Watch]]. I recommend you download a PDF copy of this watch's manual and read it before your purchase. Since my purchase, I bought and mainly wear the newer [[ASIN:B008RNKIV8 Citizen Men's AT8020-54L Blue Angels Stainless Steel Eco-Drive Dress Watch]]. I recommend the newer watch over this one, since it is similarly (or even lower) priced and the movement is more advanced.<br /><br />For some reason, I could never get the radio control function of my watch to work until I tried it in Denver, Colorado (where the US Atomic Clock is located). Since then, it has been working perfectly regardless of location. I had previously tried to make it work in Washington, DC, Boston, San Diego, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand without success. I even mailed it to the Citizen Service Center. They tested it, said it was fine, and sent it back to me with a free antenna to use with the watch to amplify the radio controlled signal reception. Since it now works, I don't use the antenna., my first dress watch, received quite a few compliments, looks like an expensive one, Great little kit. Impossible to re-apply crystal to watch after installing new battery. Without it------impossible!, Other reviews of this watch face design mentioned difficulty behind able to actually read the hands as there wasn't enough contrast between them and the face.  This is not the case with this iteration, the hands are clear against the face and very easy to read even in low light.<br /><br />I have very thin wrists and was able to remove 5 links easily and the watch fits perfectly.<br /><br />The finish of the stainless steel is &#34;stained&#34; in appearance but has an almost soft powdery feel against the skin.<br /><br />I haven't tested out the 600ft underwater depth limit yet, nor do I plan to, but it's nice to know unlike everything these days, that getting it wet won't ruin it.<br /><br />Very pleased with my purchase., This watch is just awesome. I always loved swiss army watches and this one is no different. Perfectly sized snd feels heavy and sturdy. In all honesty it made me start a watch collection, Perfect, it what exactly what i was looking for, I (female) bought this for myself because I like larger watches .I get a lot of compliments. Peoples attention goes right to my wrist and  it matches everything. I would give it 5 stars if the dial indicators & numbers glowed in  dark., Man, love this watch. OUTSTANDING. for the price your paying. It's a gem. Looks almost like a Bell&Ross, except, you don't have to pay the extra thousands of dollars. Maybe later on, the real one will come into play. For now, very happy with this watch. Looks extremely well. Well built, and arrived in a nice watch box.....Buy it. What are you waiting for?, I got this watch because I was looking for a vibration alarm that I could wear and it was one of the only ones I found.  All its features work well, but it is a LARGE watch.  I am a woman so my hands and wrists are smaller, but one of its side buttons has actually rubbed my skin raw a couple of times.  The manual is understandable and it's easy to set up the watch the way you want it., This is a great looking watch. The quality appears to be good, although the appeared to be broke, but I looked in the plastic bag the watch was in and found the pin that holds one end and after a little bit of effort it was back together. It also appear to not be running until I found a very small pices of plastic that was wedged under the stem where you set he watch, when I removed this it started to run and was then easy to set also. The wife just loves it I also got her the Platinum one as well and had less trouble with it, as all I had to do was remove the little piece of plastic under the stem which holds the stem up so the battery is not drained during shipping. My wife likes to wear a different watch for every day of the week, so finding these watches at Amazon has saved me a bunch of money. I have 3 more coming next month. I hope I have as good luck with them as I had with these. Thank you Amazon for saving this poor boys money for him., Yup, worth for what you paid and more, Changing watch batteries is often frustrating due to the difficulty of getting the back of the watch into place. This device has solved the problem with a selection of dies for putting pressure on the watch & the back without risking shattering the crystal. It gives the necessary leverage for popping the back into place. Bravo!, Just what I wanted, Exactly what I needed and ordered! Love my Amazon experiences!!, Bought this as a birthday gift for my boyfriend and Geeeeeez this watch is nice! It's very flashy and shiney.<br />It was packaged as brand new with the original Caisio box.  I hope he loves it because I sure do! And shipping was fast !, This watch is awesome!! The strap is very easy to adjust just need to cut, it has magnets to close the strap., This watch keeps moving, but loses accuracy within 5-10 minutes. Completely useless. It's fully wound, so it's not just stopping. It's about 8 minutes too slow for every hour, and I've had to adjust it too many times now. I can't trust it. Sending it back., IF you have a Space Grey Apple Watch Sport， I highly reconmend this one . The black one matches the gray Apple watch almost perfect.<br />At first , I worried that for this low price the band might look and feel &#34;cheap&#34; but it's quite the opposite.The adapter is really easy to swap out with sport band allowing me make the watch dressy or more casual based on the occasion.<br />The buyer also ship to me the band removal tool which helps me to shoten the length of the watch band., My favorite watch  -  thanks for making women's  -  the men's were to huge for my wrist, Beautiful!, only one worked, Doesn't keep time we'll over any period of time. Must be reset regularly., I've got two comments on this review which describe a breakage I encountered shortly after receiving the watch. In case you don't read those comments, be aware that I did need a repair but that I was rough with the watch and the repair has held for some time now (and would be easy to repair again in the future.)  This is a very bulky watch. If you require a slim timepiece it is not for you. It is a very blingy watch, it will catch attention, if you don't want that all the time keep a more subtle piece for backup use.  This is THE best timepiece I have ever owned. I do joke sometimes that it is like wearing a wall clock on your wrist, but I am big and bulky so it suits me handily.  The most important feature for this for me was the chronograph. I use this everyday. I find it reliable, easy to read and use. Be aware, the hour dial tracks in half hour OR tenth of a second increments. After one half hour it begins tracking half hours. The minute hand tracks up to 30 minutes (this is when the half hour replaces tenths of a second on the hour dial). Don't be confused if you are under half an hour and the hour dial spins to a random number when pausing timing, this is the tenth of a second you are on. It (the hour dial hand) spins fast for the first 30 seconds then rests.  The only thing this is missing is a perpetual calendar. I feel like, with the bulk of the thing, it could probably include one, but I do have yet to find anything even remotely slimmer with retroactive day of the week, date of the month, and a chronograph that has even slightly decent ratings in this price range.  I wouldn't mind knowing exactly how much weight in gold the gold plating adds up to, and the &#34;crowns&#34; are &#34;gold-tone&#34; while the bezel and links are 18k gold plated.  Invicta Reserve pieces have absolutely proven to me that they are worth the investment!, Really neat for the price, a lot better quality than I expected. Works great.... Alittle trouble with learning how to set, but you can look it up online. All-in- all very nice. ME and my son bought one each., The straps are totally useless.First of all, they are very poor quality and they started deteriorating from the very first week.Second,they are not wide enough to fit the Santos XL chrono( as promised) leaving a gap in between .This was my first go with Amazon and I really feel cheated., Cool and easy to use watch, Poor quality, This is my fourth Invicta Russian Diver's Watch.  I'm very happy with it. These are very sporty watches and yes, they are big!  I won't be doing any deep sea diving , just the occasional swim and a lot of dish washing., I like the watch. It's big enough to read without my glasses. My only disappointment was that the pink color I see on my computer is not the same pink as the actual watch. The watch is a darker pink. No biggie but I would have preferred the color in the picture which is a brighter pink., Amazing product and seller!, recommended!, First let me say that the accuracy of this watch is nothing short of amazing! I own several (read TOO many!) Swiss and Japanese watches and this ranks right up there with them.<br /><br />However,I gave this watch 4 stars because it is rather bland for the price (about $250.00 on Amazon).  In fact, I have some Timex watches that look more expensive.  I find it hard to believe that full retail is around $400-$450.  The blue second hand and domed mineral crystal are nice touches but the polished and buffed stainless steel look somewhat cheap next to them.  The black strap, however, is very nice and soft.  I do think for the price a sapphire crystal would be in order.  I would even pay a little more for It.<br /><br />Having said all that, I do like the watch and am happy to have an Accutron II in my collection.  Love the sweeping second hand.  Looks like an automatic without the winding!  And again, the 96B213 is incredibly accurate.  You won't miss any meetings with this watch., I have extremely small wrists so I had to remove several links.  After removing all the links that I could the watch sill did not fit snugly,  but it's a satisfactory fit for me.  It looks more like a bracelet as the band is a bit wide on my small wrists, but I like that effect.  It is elegant so I would not recommend for everyday wear., Came in with dead battery which had to be replaced before gifting..., I don't like it at all in person.  Looks online ate very deceiving.  It has a very small face, and the material looks cheap.  I'm very disappointed.  I have purchased many watches online never had a problem.  This is awful!, I'm very satisfied. This watch is cute AND inexpensive. Just like in the picture. I do wish it had gotten here a bit quicker, but it did come on time., Excellent handsome watch. I have a digital version and I really like this one. To program just walk through instructions step by step. English doc can be found in: http://support.casio.com/storage/en/manual/pdf/EN/009/qw5174.pdf. No problems getting time signal to sync with and solar cells very sensitive and worked great., After having to send back the first one, because one of the two motors involved in rotating the watches was not working, the second version seems to be working properly. I love the fact that I can store up to 16 watches in this case and that it can run on electrical current or batteries., You get what you pay for. It was real cheap so I figured I'd check it out to see if maybe it had any quality, but it's something you'd win out of a gumball machine., I read a lot of poor reviews for this and other products like it but I found it works great. It is quiet and keeps my Rolex running! I would definitely recommend this item., The watch wasn't able to sync the time ether on auto or manual mode. This was a deal breaker for me after all what good is to have an atomic watch if it doesn't work. I had to return it. I'm not sure if this is a common problem with this model but I have a ten year atomic Casio and it sync every night without problems., Elegant, handsome, and beautiful men's watch. Comes beautifully and very safely packaged - perfect condition. It was easy to set the date/day and start wearing it immediately. I purchased the blue dial model, with rotating bezel and magnified date. Has the look and feel of a more expensive watch. You will love it. Stainless steel is the only way to go, and not heavy.  Prompt shipping and arrival, as is Amazon's tradition., I'm wearing this instead of my Tag Heuer-- even for summer swimming & beach because my tag battery is more exp. to replace than this whole watch and this looks as nice if not nicer., I love Anne Klein watches; always have.  This one is beautiful and so easy to remove and put back on.  I get compliments each time I wear it!, A, Keeps decent time. Is cat-themed. Not too expensive.  Just what I was after. The watch face is faceted: the highest point is in the center, and then the clear cover slopes away from the center in pie-wedge shapes towards the outer circle of the face. Sort of like the roof of a circular tent. It looks fine, but it can throw the reflection a bit. If you look at the image, you'll notice the light shining on the face is in a Pie-chart-wedge-shape. That is the shape of the cover. It isn't a problem, but it takes a little bit to get used to it., It's not A1 quality. I consider it B- quality. It's second hand has significant slippery issue while setting time. Otherwise, so far, it's working fine., The design is amazing I love it but the watch is very very small, I bought it for me but I'm not going to use it, because it looks like a women's watch, I just wasted my money, I have been on the search for the perfect MK watch that suits me and my needs. I have to say I've found it. The face is not too large and not too small, just perfect. The silver tone is not too flashy and overstated, just perfect. It has a separate second hand which I need as a nurse, and the color will not tarnish from all the hand washing I do all day long. Perfect enough for everyday and going out. I highly recommend this MK beauty., Does the job done!, Thanks to this, I don't have to stop by a watch shop anymore. It is very easy to use., I have this model watch for a long time. I buy a new one every few years as mine gets beat up from wearing it to work everyday!! Amazon have the best price on this watch...., Bought this watch for my son's graduation and he loves it.  A beautiful, classic style.  Came extremely well cushioned and protected during delivery,, This was a GREAT watch. Did everything I expected it to do (keep time, of course) and more (it has a stopwatch feature and a night vision light). Sadly, the band broke, so I rigged to to continue to wear it, but it fell off of my wrist and is now forever lost. Definitely worth the price, wasn't worth the shipping time, though., This is a very beautiful, sturdy looking watch. But don't buy on looks alone. This is surprisingly delicate for a mechanical watch. The winding mechanism provides little to no resistance, making it very easy to over wind the spring and break the watch. Looks great as a prop piece, but you must be careful if you are to use it on a daily basis., Super cute, feminine watch. Dial is easy to read and the multiple colors of metal means I can wear it with silver or gold!, very googd, Love this watch. The face is definitely large. It is very stylish, comfortable. Very happy I made this purchase., First, this is a well made watch.  Second, the picture doesn't do it justice, it's a great look with a heavy feel.  Third, be aware it is larger than I expected!<br /><br />The box and watch itself is very nice.  I worry when choosing gifts that the item might arrive in a cheap package and no matter the price it will make it feel cheap.  This is not the case.  The box and instructions, watch, tag etc. are very nice-an expensive feel.  I love that, especially when choosing gifts.<br /><br />The watch is well built, or at least at this point that is how I feel.  It is heavy and feels durable.  The buttons/knobs at the side of the watch are easy to use, even for larger hands.  The face is huge and easy to read.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this, just be aware it is larger than you might assume!, Needed one of these for years., Every thing I expected.....my 1st experience with this watch maker. Praying i made a good choice!, i swim daily with it on. Able to see time @ night. It does its job as advertised. solid buy., I was really surprised at how great the quality was for such a low price. It is although, a lot larger than I expected which in turn resembles a more masculine watch. I would have preferred a more petite version. Still working on figuring out how to operate the many functions. The instructions could be better. Good quality watch., to heavy, as advertised, For the price it was a steal! However, slow shipping hence the 4 stars. I have big wrists and I'm using the 2nd button. If you have a small wrist this may not work. Very happy!!!, It was real nice watch for my husband gift., Got this watch for a trip to a certain city notorious for pickpockets and didn't want to risk my Tag. Love the clean basic style and did it job. The face is a bit on the small size for a man, but not too bad. Its biggest fault is the strap. It is far, far too short. I am 6'0&#34; and 180lbs, and the band barely fit my wrist and had to use the very last hole. So if your wrists run even moderately big, you may want to steer away from this., 100% recomendado, not to big, but still heavy weight watch ! But it looks really good, excellent option to choose., Horrible watch the bands broke while I tried it on the strap is peeling I only had it for a week had them check the diamonds that are real is like one small spec you can't even see these are those 5 dollar watches you get In downtown, This is a terrific slight improvement in a classic. I have been wearing them forever and every once in a while I need to replace.  Wanted one with a count down time for cooking a several models did not have.  When I searched for one with a count down time I got one listed at $150 and I could not figure out what it had otherwise that would justify more than $125 more than this watch.  Casio, please don't stop making this watch.  Thanks for improving the way data are shown on first screeni.  Time day date year all very easy to see., Awsome, Looks perfect and seems to keep perfect time. I'm a professional Santa and planning to use this as part of my costume. It's the small details that can set you apart from the crowd ..., The watch I receive don't work very bad watch !!!!!!!!!!,, Beautiful watch, perfect oversized watch and it's not to heavy., Beautiful watch that can be worn as a dressy rugged look or can be worn for everyday wear.  I had so many compliments on it from women in the office.  They were looking for a women's version of the watch (smaller face)., Unfortunatelly I didn't like it. I wanted it for  my Swiss Legend watch and it was too much different quality., Product was defective. Stopped working after 2 weeks., it's a big and unique stylish watch from Columbia, the shipping was prompt. when I took the old band off and compared it too the new one I noticed the new one being a little smaller in overall size, ie., not as beefy as the original. also the buckle is chrome on the new one. original is black. I switched buckles. the new band does fit and I'm using it. the question is: has casio &#34;slimmed down&#34; their bands? or was a co_____f_it band shipped to me., Easy to use. Works on Jewelry and glasses that have never been cleaned., Glass covering fell off after a year, It's just a waste and give a slight accidental blow and stops working.<br /><br />es un desperdicio apenas y le das un leve golpe accidental y deja de funcionar, The exterior of the case is of good quality.  The interior of mine was in shambles, the cardboard partitions were all knocked down most likely do to shipping.  I was able to reassemble it and seems to be holding up well for now.  The huge disappointment, and the reason for the 2 stars, for me is that the &#34;removable pillows&#34; are missing.  Without the pillows the watches just flop to the bottom and look messy.  The photos show it with pillows and the description says &#34;with removable pillows.  To not include them is wrong.<br /><br />Thank you,, i like it, I was told the recipient liked it, Watch band completely broke off pin., Great watch, a bit tedious to set up, but once done it runs on its own. The watch is rather large, but you barely feel it on your hand. Highly recommended!, This watch is beautiful. Solid construction, clean crisp face. You can see the time clearly. I have a collection of 20 watches and this one just fit right into the top ten., ike the watch, it is a real conversation starter!, Excelent!, The watch is excellent. After a month of use, it still operates, keeps accurate time, shines like new, and the face isn't scratched.<br /><br />This watch feels solid to the touch and it has a premium construction. It came in very nice packaging with a felt covered, hard watch case.<br /><br />My only issue are the link pins and the lack of instructions on how to remove them. I've owned 40+ watches and have adjusted the size of the band on nearly every one. I do it so often that I purchased a highly rated jewelers tool kit specifically for removing link pins and resizing watch bands. The Alexander watch uses a pin that I've never seen before. Not only were there not instructions in the user manual, you can't find anything on the Internet (I tried Google, Facebook, YouTube, jewelers forums, etc). I'm extremely tech savvy and I couldn't even find a hint. Even when looking up &#34;every type of watch pin and how to remove it&#34;, there was no mention of this type. To make it even more deceiving, there are etched arrows on the inside of the band which is supposed to always indicate that it's a push pin and that's the direction you remove it. After hours of trying and searching the Internet, I had to visit 3 jewelers before one figured it out. There are flat head screw holes on both sides. That's typically cosmetic, but not in this case. In order to remove the pin, you need 2 people and 2 tiny screwdrivers. One person has to hold one side of the pin still while the other person screws the other end out like you would a screw and bolt setup.<br /><br />I'm not sure how there are not explicit instructions somewhere to explain these unusual pins. I had the watch for a week before I wore it due to this. I'd have to imagine some less patient people returning this watch out of frustration. That is the only negative and I would've rated 5 stars if instructions were able to be found., Time will tell., Invicta makes very stylish watches, I buy them to give as gifts when I travel overseas to family, and everyone appreciates receiving them., I was looking for a Velcro band for the watch but I got this awesome watch for this price totally worth it..., Work horse of a watch. From hiking to work to just walking this watch has the ability to do it. At one point it fell in water and was completely fine., I have been using this pocket watch with watch attached to a leather key fob. The fob allows the watch to be protected by any coins or keys I may have next to it in my pocket.<br />This watch, within about 2 weeks had most of the finish rubbed off of the metal back plate. The plastic crystal is also easily scratched or marred just by walking around with it in my pocket throughout the day.<br />By the way, I only take this Gotham with me 2-3 times a week, so it sees only light to medium wear and tear.<br />Yes, the watch keeps good time and the thin size is a good feature. I have another pocket watch that I bought for about $14.00 at a well known discount superstore and it has held up much better over a longer period of time than the Gotham. Save yourself some money and shop around, unless you have to have an extra thin pocket watch., These watches are large .However they say water resistant,THEY ARE NOT!!I wore in the shower and it actually filled up with water.I have cheap watches I wear to do yard work and in the shower that hold up better than these do.So as a novelty I guess there okay but I wouldn't buy again or wear doing dishes or in the shower.I didn't want something I have to remove when I'm near water., I have small wrists so I had to take some links out but I really like the watch., very happy, The clip that holds the little door shut wears out on these after a little while.  Had to super-glue it shut.  Luckily, you can still tell the time.  This occurred with several of the different styles I purchased for my partner., Very nice, better than I thought, but read the instructions before you try to set the date!, My son is absolutely in love with this watch. It is very good quality and allows the links to come out to fit a smaller wrist, Very cute!!  My g'son loved it even though he can't tell time!!, Extremely disappointed with this strap. I purchased this strap at the same time as one from another company. The other strap arrived in less than a week. This strap took 3. On top of that, the quality was horrible. The strap is very thin and the rings feel very flimsy.. Stay away from this strap., this was a gift for my cousin, Son Loves this watch.  Light weight, classy, dressy. just what my 18 yr old son was looking for.  He would purchase again., I really like the way it looks, like very sophisticated and its just really nice, This one i liked., 100% recomendado, This watch was perfect! I'm kind of in love.<br /><br />I use an Apple Watch for my day to day, but this little watch actually gets used a lot. It is absolutely perfect for any outdoor activity or other situation when you need a seriously tough little watch. Its also a perfect travel companion.<br /><br /> According to Casio, this thing is only supposed to be water resistant, and isn't really meant for swimming. Well aren't they a bunch of jokers! I have swam for hundreds of hours with this watch on. In pools, rivers, lakes, oceans, and believe it or not, THE DEAD SEA!!! I am truly flabbergasted by the quality for how cheap it is. I honestly expected to break this watch over a dozen times by now, in fact I never bought it to last, it was really only meant for one trip.<br /><br />Just so there are no surprises, the materials are what you would expect for a watch this cheap. Its all plastic hardware, and a simple thin resin strap, but somehow it has all held up. It still feels cheap in your hand at first, but after a while wearing it, you will realize how tough it really is., I love Skagen watches and have had 3 of them consecutively.  I liked the durability of the watch because I was a teacher and always knocking my watch around.  I have been a very proud owner until I just gave this watch to my cousin for retirement.  It's too late to return it because the gift was not sent right away.  My cousin received it and shortly after noticed a small crack in the crystal.<br />I never had heard about the crystal cracking defect.  Both my cousin wanted to buy a Skagen until they read about the easily cracking crystal.  My watch was just the opposite!!!  I didn't know there was such a controversy until I started to read many reviews on Amazon.  I like Skagen and hope they find what is causing this terrible blunder to their watches.  I still would  buy a fourth Skagen!, Excellent product, battery dead, product defective...returned for replacement..was on time, I did love this and got lots of compliments but the band was rubber and split after only a week., Beautiful buy., perfect for my 7 year old grandson.  He is still learning to tell time, My son likes it. It's a little cheap and took a long time to ship., Just got my watch today. I'm love it so far. Is it much bigger then the both of GD6900 30th anniversary model that I have. I would said is approx the same size as the Mudman and the Rangeman that I own. Also package came everything perfect too, as everyone are G Shock collector or owner. Always want there packaging arrived nice and prefect. I would highly recommend this vendor. Thanks again Amazon., This is a real disappointment, I bought this a month ago and the red color had faded and streaked. I was not happy with the rose gold buckle, there no description that it came that way and does not match my stainless steel watch, My daughter loves the watch. It goes with everything, is attractive, and water resistant. Very nice., This watch is fun and easy to read! The retail orice listed is definately off, but worth the Amazon.com asking price!, Great looking watch. Keeps excellent time, has not lost a second yet. I resized the bracelet myself using directions I found online, which was fairly easy and took &#60;15 minutes. Its quite hefty and the case is.. substantial. Its actually quite thick but I like that. The middle portion of the bracelet is raised and polished which is very good looking. If you're not looking to spend thousands on a Rolex, then this is a very good choice.<br /><br />Here is the link to the directions I found for resizing the bracelet: https://justasmallblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/19/how-to-resize-a-seiko-collar-and-pin-watch-band/#comments, The watch arrived on time. I was floored at the case and removing the wrapping this watch HAD the best looking face and resin body I've ever seen. A bit hard to see hour hand in low light,set timer to 3 seconds on face light and in low light hit the light button and hold your hand over the face about LESS then an inch and both hands will be seen. Practice a few times adjusting everything until you get it. Other reviews complain about this low light problem but do nothing about it. It's. An extremely fine watch worthy of finding a fix to solve it. I get complements all the time. And price, where did I get it. Best watch I've bought since the last 4 Gshocks I bought., It's a gift for my friend. I just wonder why it could only connect to IPHONE, why not Android phones?, 不能防水Not waterproof, its not well fineshed , parts of the bracelet is without painting. not elegant at all, it looks cheap!!!, Arrived on time.  Excellent watch.  I used it at work and fishing.  It tells me what the tide is.  I only have to input some data where my location is to show the tide info., Grate product for the price, Excellent merchandise!  It was delivered on time in a beautiful black box suitable for gifting.  With adjustable pins built-in to its strap ends, anchoring the straps to the watch case was a breeze.  There are no enclosed instructions or illustrations for how the band is supposed to connect and close/open, but, being a wizened old codger, I was able to figure it out in a few minutes.  I could have solved the puzzle quicker if the clasp that opens and closes to secure the retainer pin into a chosen hole on the strap had not been so tight.  Because I was afraid of breaking it, it took me a while to determine that the buckle (clasp) had to snap upward and pivot along the tiny pin hinge at the base.  An embossing on the inside of the strap reads, &#34;Genuine Alligator Hand Made USA.&#34; The outside of the strap is obviously made of dyed and polished alligator skin, but the inner band material may be man-made.  The strap is handsome overall, and opens/closes quickly and securely.  The strap is stiff on initial use but molds to the shape of the wrist after a few days of wear., My niece likes it, This band is perfect for my watch.  If there were other colors, I would order them immediately .  Woven bands allow me to fasten at the place I need for my small wrist., fun watch, It is not good quality , quickly lost color and 3 weeks, It look elegant, works perfect. Shipped immediately., I like the look and comfort  of the watch but I did not know it was a watch that I had to wind up every day.  I expected a watch that had a battery., Very nice band... I replaced the original band on my Swiss Military.. Looks great..., The band is very stiff and cheap looking, but the face is beautiful and is very classy., Dakota claims to have excellent warranties, but not so.  I received one of these watches for Xmas a few years ago, and the first time I took it diving, the crystal came off the front, and thus the inner workings rusted. The watch was supposed to be waterproof.  When making a claim, I was told:  (1) no matter how I received the watch, I needed to prove purchase before they would warrant; and (2) only the inner workings of the watch are covered by warranty, with the crystal NOT covered at all, so they would charge $20 to repair.  Buy a different brand and check the warranty before purchase., I have become a bit of a watch collector but needed to replace my everyday watch.  I have at least a dozen (mostly Swiss) watches ranging from diver to dress for various occasions.  However, I've been a fan of Casio for their combination of value + quality + accuracy since my 1st G-Shock in the early 80s.  I certainly intended to spend more than thirty two bucks for my EDC but I liked the design and couldn't help myself.  I've had it for 6 months now and don't regret it a bit.  The feature set is perfect and setting the analog time is simply a function of the watch synching itself to the digital time.  That definitely wasn't the case with my last Casio digi-ana.  That one required you to hold down a button for a very long time since it only moved forward, making the fall DST change a real hassle.  Another problem I encountered was that when approaching the 10-year limit of the battery life, the accuracy of the watch suffered quite a bit rather than the watch just stopping.  I'll watch for that in a few years but for now it's only off by about a second a month which is good by any standard., This watch is a little larger than I expected. But I like it, especially as bigger watches are stylish now too., Awesome, My 8 year grandson loves Legos and Emmet! Perfect replica. Sturdy, functional, good size, and great price. Very pleased!, I have always liked a analog & digital combination watch. I like always having the correct date (instead of manually adjusting it for months that do not have 31 days). This watch is great. In addition to the ana/digi face, it has atomic time adjustment and a solar battery. The face isn't huge like a lot of watches of this type. It's sleek and comfortable., Good quality, though I expected better quality as Stuhrling is a high quality brand. Everything seem very nice finished however the seconds indicator is poorly designed relatively to high quality finishing watch. I was expecting overall better wuality watch!, great product, good weight and solid feel. To small for my wrist is the only issue, Amazing watch for the price. I get many looks from other watch lovers., It has kept perfect time for the week that I've had it. Very easy to read. The hands don't glow for very long but that's nothing. I wanted something for water sports (fishing and swimming) but I'm not sure if I'll actually wear it swimming because the screw down crown seems to come a little loose on its own, I have to give it half a twist about once each day. Maybe loose is still enough for a water seal, I don't know. I have large wrists and normally get frustrated with short straps but this strap is large enough. This is my first bigger watch and I'm still not used to the size but my wife tells me it looks good so that's that. No ticking noise unless I really try to hear it. Second hand hits its marks perfectly. For a Casio, this is great.  Update a few weeks later. The glass front (I think that is called the crystal) cracked for no reason at all. Now condensation is inside. I'm glad I did not pay more. Back to the drawing board., exellent, I had my first G-Shock for 8 - 9 years and then gave it to my son a couple of weeks ago. It still works perfectly and looks good. I went ahead and bought the Japan version with the carbon fiber insert band for one reason. I had to replace the band on my first G-Shock twice, because both bands cracked after a few years of use. The non-carbon fiber insert band on this runs about $60, so I figure I'll spend the extra money now and hopefully this band will last a long time -- saving me time and maybe some money.<br /><br />I've only had this watch for a week, but I already love it and I am trust Casio G-Shock!, Cheap quality and not manufactured to last. If you are looking for a decent quality watch band, buy something else., Excellent watch. Eye catcher and very com<br />fortable., The width of the watch would only be pleasing for a woman (or Caitlyn) and I don 't know if I got a returned watch but the band is only barely long enough to fit my male wrist whereas most men's watch bands have extra links, and I frankly bought it for a woman based on its appearance (it really is a gorgeous jewel with a sapphire face that sub $600 Apple watches don't have and 100 meter water resistance that would drown any Apple product). The case is 11 mm thick due to kinetic recharging mechanism which may not be petite enough - one concern is if using arms to animatedly gesture while talking, the reeling sound of that mechanism may be noticeable. But hey - never have to open the case to replace battery! I just noticed it's not currently available - it was a fantastic deal, It works but it is a very large faced watch., This watch looks so nice.  I wear it daily. It has just the right amount of &#34;bling.&#34; I never shower or swim with it. The crystal face is very durable and in 10 months, I only have one small scratch on it.  HOWEVER, 2 of the numbers have fallen off and are free floating around in the watch's face!  The second hand gets stuck on the numbers and then won't work.  I can't believe it.  What a huge bummer!  I would not recommend buying this product!, Simply perfect. I had one before. Also casio but not Gshock and I wasnt pleased. This one is perfect though, exellent, Was a Bday gift for Hubby. It fits very well and is easily adjusted. Looks exactly like the pic. He loves it., Initial impressions: great price, solid product and easy to use! Let's see how durable it is with daily use in a salt water, Oustanding watch  for the money. Very durable and bendable., CHeap - was returned., I bought two!  I have  7 and 9 year old granddaughters. It runs really large,.... perhaps for an adult size wrist. I'll have to take it to a jeweler to get it sized. But, it's a quality watch., Awesome product, great quality. Be aware that if you are being this for a kid or a person that's very thin than it may look a bit bog on them because the watch is a bit thick itself. But I recommend it to anyone other then that., Excellent watch. Accurate, easy to read, nice features, stylish, solid and dependable. Easy on easy off. This fricken watch rules. I'm going to buy another to wear on my other arm like ah stew-kah., Love this watch!!  Wear it to work everyday it's indestructible and looks nice at the same time:), Excellent, Very nice watch probably the best watch in its price range fast shipping couldn't be happier ..., I have had this watch for less than a year and am disappointed with it.  The second hand no longer ticks off each second, but jumps about 4-7 seconds each time it moves.  Somehow it is able to keep accurate time but, as a nurse, I need to be able to reliably view the seconds passing.  Thinking it was simply a dying battery, I replaced that, but it still doesn't work correctly., I really like the watch however, the calendar function isn't working correctly.  I have had many watches with this function and never had one t hat I could not adjust correctly.  Should I return it and get another?   Good news..... I turned the time back 12 hours and it all works perfectly!!!!! I love the watch, Very pretty watch.  Had to go to jeweler to remove a couple of links as it was quite large when it arrived.  I haven't really had it long enough to know about longevity, etc., I've only had it for a short time,but thus far it has exceeded my expectations. Every thing seems to be as advertised., This band was a fine addition to the leather band that came with my Moto 360.  The tools included were a nice touch but mostly ineffective in getting the original band removed.  Fortunately, I had already purchased a much nicer tool for @$7.  Once I finally learned to get the pins installed (I'm not a jeweler), I gave a good tug on both ends of the band and they felt secure.  I wore the watch several times without incident.  I can't seem to find a way to remove one link that I think will give me a snugger fit on my wrist but it is otherwise very attractive and comfortable.<br /><br />My problem is the band suddenly just dropped off my wrist!!!!  Lucky for me I was just pumping gas and the watch landed on the band itself when it hit the concrete so no damage to the watch.  What was worrying is only 15 minutes earlier I was riding my motorcycle on the freeway.  Had the same thing happened then, the watch would have been history!!<br /><br />I do not know how the watch came apart, the link that fits to the watch (that holds the pin) did not show any damage and when I got home I was able to install a new pin into the watch.  I will keep an eye on this band and not expose my watch to any potential situations I could loose the watch (like wearing it while riding) until I have some confidence this won't happen again., Got it for a gift for a friend love the way it looks I might just get this for my self can't have too many watches., It is fashionable and it looks and feels good. I would recommend that the bracelet be made more flexible. The battery delivered with lasted only one week. Useful to know that it uses 377 type., need to improve belt quality. looks like the belt and battery will constantly need to be replaced, eventually leading to another watch purchase., Cute. Poor stitching, so cool !!!!, It fits my paw1300 but somehow it looks like missing something from the band. I'm going to keep it for extra. I'm still looking for same bands that came with the watch., Purchased for my daughter before going to college.  She loved the size and the look of the watch, unfortunately the crystal face fell out after a few months.  The watch was not dropped or abused - obviously a manufacturers defect.  We contacted the company and they informed us that the crystal was not covered under warranty.  The cost to fix it was more than the cost to replace it.  Very disappointed with Armitron customer service.  All that to say, it's a very nice looking watch, but don't expect the company to stand behind their product if it fails., This is a nice-looking, easy to read watch.  Looks good whenever you wear it.  Fits well -- not too tight.  My wrist is 6 inches.  I like it very much., The watch arrived damaged because it is not keeping the time and the needle timer is moving along without pressing the button., Not really blue. More green., The watch is heavy on my wrist, and there is no back light or glow making it difficult to read in low light.  After 3 weeks of normal wear a chip developed on the edge of my glass, humidity and moisture then condensed on the inside of my watch face and then it stopped running all together.  Normally I would give this one star, but I contacted the warranty folks and they had me send it in for repair or replacement.  I have not receieved the watch back yet, and so I may change this to one star eventually.  The other knock I have is on how easily the 'ring around the face' scratches.  I had this out of the box for 24 hours, just wearing it around the house and somehow it picked up a scratch on the ring.<br /><br />That being said, I do like the styling., It's a beaut!, As with all Casio watches this one inb particular has its good and bad features.  The watch is classy, different, and I know will last...On the negative side I found the so called illumination to be almost nill....and to date some of the programing a bit difficult.  Should have been easy to set<br />the time for this city by zeroing in on the key city for the region..........did not happen.............will keep trying though............<br />I have had numerous Casio watches and they last through showers, nursing, teaching swimming, thats is why I prefer one of these to<br />an &#34;expensive&#34; watch., Its a mans watch!, Purchased as new and was used and scratched with missing links., Nice design.<br />However, the digital clock can not be seen clearly at night, EXCELLENT, Cool watch, Excellent product, Average quality, not for professional use but adequate for the home owner., I love the face of this watch, although the band did come off easily, that didn't worry me too much. The glass of the face is what broke very quickly.. I've yet to replace it., Stylish, Accurate and comfortable to wear.  What more can you ask for?  And yes - reasonable in price., Came damaged. Plus it is too small for the average man;'s wrist. I think the concept and the style are really cool. Wish it had a larger circumference. The numbers are easy to read and it is unusual. Had to send it back., Just what I wanted., Junk, Elegant and simple design. Love the rose gold finish. Very feminine, strings come out of sides and always have to cut off, Better looking than any of my Dad's very high end watches. Keeps time just fine for me and it is very light weight in your hand but feels very sturdy on your wrist., It is an interesting looking watch. Works well so far., This watch has a nice, thin design and looks great. But like a lot of watches around the $100 price level, it's not durable. Within two weeks of wearing it the crystal popped off. I hadn't dropped it or banged it against any surface -- it simply came off, as if it hadn't been attached correctly in the first place., Some people are just too picky with watches. I think this watch is reasonably priced and doesn't look cheap at all. It all depends on how you style it with your outfits. The gold might possibly fade through time with the band's constant contact on skin. This is based on the band material. I've had a gold ALDO watch with the same price as this, and the gold faded slightly through time because the band material was also alloy plated with gold. But then again, you get what you pay for right? At least you didn't spend a ton of money over something that'll still fade. Happens to MK gold watches too! (Experience from my friend's genuine MK watch).  This one actually looks like an MK dupe though, but who cares? This watch is cute!, I love this watch. It's so simple and understated, and looks great if your a smaller dude like me.<br /><br />Things to know:<br />-The light works really well.--The clasp is adjustable by sliding back and forth on the band, not the links of the band.--The band is very thin for a metal watch, at least half and possible a third of the thickness of many other metal linked bands.--The description says the case is metal, but it is metallic plastic thing at best. Feels cheap, but looks great. Probably doesn't take a scratch well, but I don't know yet. The back plate is full on stainless steel.--I get compliments on it all the time.--It can be a bit of an arm hair puller if you're sensitive to that, but I think most metal bands are.<br /><br />UPDATE: Case is holding up well and may be stainless after all. Hairs stopped pulling out after some initial adjustment period. I still love the watch!, I have opened my watches in the past with a pair of needle nose pliers. More times than not, I have scratched the back of the watch trying to open it. This tool is inexpensive, built well and more importantly - it works. I wish I had bought one sooner., Lovely watch with a classic look. It's pretty impressive to get an automatic at this price. I still opted for the [[ASIN:B005UONA6W Tissot T0636171603700 Tradition Men's Chrono Quartz Silver Dial Watch with Brown Leather Strap]] instead for a more modern look, but I was really torn between choosing this on and the Tissot Tradition Chrono. I would definitely consider this for a second watch., Interesting, military-inspired design but the watch -- as sold -- has two flaws:  1) the luminous material used on the hands and small hour markers is inferior (very weak) and 2) the thick nylon band is uncomfortable and increases the thickness of the watch significantly.  I own and have owned many Victorinox watches and they are typically excellent.  I won't hesitate to purchase this brand again -- just not this particular model.  I have no doubt that others may not have an issue with my two complaints., Fantastic watch, goes well on every occasion and you bound to get compliments for this one.<br /><br />Accurate timing and the best part is the eco drive technology that surpasses all!! I would say it's a must have in your collection  with all its bells n whistles :), Very nice watch. I gave it to my grandson, who is using it while running track. It is very similar to my G-Shock, except that it is MUCH lighter & does not have the sync to the atomic clock feature., Broke the second my son put it on.  Never returned it but other than that it was ok., got this for my father over a year and a half ago. He loves it and its still working great. Had a little trouble with the clasp that holds it closed but went to the local jeweler and they fixed it for free., The lens broke from the inside! So now the hands won't move. It was dropped or banged around. This is an expensive watch, this shouldn't have happened after such a short time., Had it for about 8 months now.<br />Sent quickly with nice packing.  Comes with generic manual that covers watches with more/less features.<br /><br />The watch itself is great.  Band is comfortable.  Leather and stitching is great quality, no flaws on mine.  The internal parts are all nice and shiny, no smudges left over from manufacturing.  Couldn't be happier with the black on gold look.  Very reflective golden look.<br /><br />A single 'charge' or wind-up will make my watch last just under 24 hours sitting there.  While on wrist moving around, it is about 1.5 days? before I need to wind again.  I've been adventurous with the watch and no failures yet.  Nor has the glass been scratched yet or the black bezel started flaking of scratching...suggesting this is very well made.  I keep thinking one day this has to start getting beat up...I don't go easy with it on.  But somehow it's still fine.<br /><br />Con (4 star):  The time is a bit fast.  After about 12 hours, it's about 2-3min ahead.  After a day, it's about 5min ahead.  However, the control knob to reset time is a simple twist of the dial and done., I purchased this watch when it was listed as either deal of the day or lightning deal on Amazon. While I can't remember the specific type of sale, it was a good price so I ordered without hesitation. I was looking for a watch with a timer feature. This watch can be set to any time you wish on the timer. I prefer this to some similar watches that have preset times you must choose from. This lights up at the push of a button.  This is also a nice feature.  My only negative is that the strap has turned blue. I suspect this is from resting my arm on my jeans while sitting. Aside from the start discoloration, the features of the watch are quite nice and the watch appears to be well made., I bought this watch at least a year ago.  Lost it.  Moved furniture.  Still lost.  Threw a load of wash into the dryer.  Something clanking.  Sure enough,  this poor little watch was in a pocket...took it out and it was keeping perfect time.  JUST TICKING AWAY.  I found it four days ago.  Still ticking., This product was terrible, and Amazon is terrible for selling it. The watch stopped working the same day and it does not complete all the functions listed in the product details. JUST TERRIBLE, I want my money back., Suitable for my child in eight years old .. Very beautiful and luxurious and high- quality, Nice looking watch. Only worked for a year and now cannot get any help with a return. A warranty is only as good as the people behind it., I love this watch! I always get people asking me where I got it, for the price it's great, easy to read (although difficult sometimes to read outside in bright sunshine). I will probably buy one in gold soon. Happy with it!, Like it, Beautifully made, really classy watch., The price and color were what attracted me... $20 for a digital watch from a brand that has been around for awhile. The watch band is decently thin and the face is nice and large making the wear comfortable and the time an easy read. The setup was really easy, I just followed the instructions that came with the watch. I have been using it when I coach youth soccer for the past week and am thoroughly happy with the product, circling back to the price i feel like I've already gotten the value out of it!, Ok, Two days after received the watch it's behind 15 minutes every 24 hours, The interior links scratches. The outside gold links scratches. Returned for refund.very disappointed., Watch worked awesome for about 3 months, then the strap broke., This watch is a little gem for the price. I bought this watch as an 'activities' watch. I took it to the beach thinking that if it broke, oh well. For $15, what can you expect. I also use this watch when I golf. I don't even notice it's there. For the price this watch is definitely worth it., Not perfect. It sometimes works, sometimes not, I am very happy with this purchase!!!!, Everything seemed, like this is what I was expecting. After a couple of days trying I sent it back. The hands are hard to see in dark.It does have led light, but probably that was turning point. I was not sure if I need all of the stuff that this watch can do, but I was sure that I want to see the time in the dark without pushing any buttons. It's a great watch, but not for me., Bought these for my sons aged 8 & 10. They love the large orange face with digital numbers. My kids didn't even bother to read the instructions and were able to figure out how to set the watch and work its basic functions. They've had these for 6+ months with no problems (although we have not worn these in water)., We purchased this watch for my 10 year old son for his birthday. He loves this watch. It is very easy to use, and operate for his age. The velcro strap is wonderful, and makes it very easy for my son to take it on and off by himself. He wore his watch to the pool the first day he received it and it works great., I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted., recommended !!! excellent !!, Fun watch, I received this beauty as a gift last Christmas. I really love this watch. The power reserve is nowhere near as good as my Orient Blue Mako, but that doesn't really matter to me too much. The movement is much smoother and is hacking (which means squat to me because I don't exact second set my watches. You get a novel day and date display, neat exhibition case back and a solid weight/build timepiece. Personally, I lust after an Omega. However, I need to eat, so my watch collection is sub $1,000 right now. So, this and my Orient fit that bill. I am satisfied. You can't go wrong but be prepared for repeated Cameron meetings, etc., Like the size, Love the two tone color, and crystals. Nice Watch  Thank You, Granddaughter likes it., the worst purchase I have ever made, product as expected, delivered on time, My husband is enjoying his new sports watch!, It's for Xmas pressie!, Nice water resistant sports watch. It is a little bigger than my dressier watch, but not by much. The clear color goes with anything. I wear it when doing outside work. I like not having to worry about it getting wet. Cleans off easy too.  If I am working in the garden long, the band can get kind of slick, making it a little hard to undo, but this isn't a huge problem, as I can simply rinse and dry the watch off.<br /><br />I use the timer as well. With four kids I always have to remember to do something., Deficiently not RED!, I read a lot of reviews on various cheap winders.  If you're trying to stay under a few hundred dollars for a single unit this is the best choice.  The plastic case looks better in photos but it does the job and the various settings are required for different watches.  The LCD display and the buttons are much better quality than I expected.  The watch holster is also a very clever design and is spring loaded to put tension on most sized watches.  I have an 8.25 inch wrist and this holds my watches in place nicely.<br /><br />REGARDING THE CLUNKING - It's b.s. The clunking only happens when I put in my Rolex Deep Sea.  This thing weighs 230 grams or more depending on the links and diver extension installed.  And the carriage that holds the watch cannot be made to fit into it's cup with laser precision or otherwise you would be there all day trying to align the parts.  There has to be a mm or two of free play so you can slide in the carriage with ease.  When I removed this watch and put on my ceramic Submariner, which is about 175 grams, the clunking noise was 98% gone.  And when I put on my Milgauss, which is 160 grams, it's totally silent.<br /><br />Almost all watches, even massive 44mm swiss watches, don't weigh as much as Rolex, so as long as you're under 150 grams, which is still very very substantial, this little box operates beautifully.  None of my pieces are overwound and I don't have to keep setting the time and date and wearing out my crown, stem, pinion, gaskets, etc which will cost me a heck of a lot more to replace than these winders will.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, I say do it.  These are on eBay for $67 and up.  This is a great price with free shipping., this watch when worn receives lots of attention, Impressive quality and precision case plus outstanding timekeeping right out of the box, use it everyday!, Excellent, Great size for my 10 year old's wrist. He wanted a watch like his dads with the sports bells and whistles. This fit the bill perfectly.  Would also work well on a small woman's wrist., it was damaged when i receive it !!!!, Fantastic watch band, nice dark brown colour & tapered for comfort.  Great Price.  I ordered the wrong size and was unhappy to send it back., I got it, What more do you want, I gave it to my bitch on the side she like it hope my wife don't find out!!!, Very small, Cool looking watch and it fits my tiny thin wrist!  Love that it has indiglo too.  Packaging looked a bit damaged, but all paperwork was there and the watch was fine, so I don't really care, it wasn't a gift.  Wrist band is best for small wrists., Thank you my boyfriend loves it. Exactly how i expected. And its arrived even sooner., I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted., The white numbers on the pink border rubbed off on the first day my daughter wore it.  She was excited to learn how to use the numbers to tell time, but the numbers aren't there and she is disappointed.  Rip off., Beautiful watch, a head turner!, A little bit small for someone with bigger hands/wrists but a very classy looking watch., Alright, This is my &#34;girlfriend&#34; watch.  Big, full featured, and does a lot of things if you know what buttons to push.  Maybe a little wierd., Excellent, It was alright the first week but it stopped working after 2 weeks of use worst watch ever I would spend my money on a apple watch, Awesome watch, the compass, barometer, & battery saver option make this watch a new favorite of mine. Highly recommend., The delivery was on time, but the Watch were stopped. I really hope it's not broken, I hope that it's just a matter of dead battery., Feels good but it looks like a small watch on my wrist... I have another 40mm watch with a leather strap and it looks very appropriate because it has a narrow bezel, this watch has a wide bezel that I'm not too fond of., too bad， not even working. Anybody tell me how can I return it!!!!, Excellent product and fast delivery!, Just got my watch today - it's gorgeous!  I love that this is a 3-hand watch and it is so dainty and beautiful looking.  It doesn't look very expensive, but I wanted an every day watch so that I can keep my other watches for special occasions., So far holding up well.  I haven't had the problem of the white color wearing off and it still is in pretty good shape in the several months I've had it., great band for a large watch. better than other Nato straps I've used., This watch has a Japan movement not a Swiss one, it's either fake or I was ripped off ... Watch looks good but too light to be original., Boy this watch is cheaply made, but for the price what do you expect?, This is the 3rd Relic watch I've bought (over several years.)  I love the design and the quality.  My only complaint with this watch is that occasionally the latch comes undone, but not really a big deal.  I would buy this again., Exellent, An elegant watch that really stands out. It's big, but not too big. I really like the look with business casual but it is versatile enough to wear as a casual watch or dressing up. I am very pleased with the purchase. Other reviewers are correct, something about the strap makes it sit on the wrist funny. It always seems like the dial is tilting away from you when you want to read the time., Really outstanding winder having no issues with the product, Sturdy and heavy watch that resembles a Rolex at a fraction of the price. Comes with a mini-diver hard case box., I've had this watch for a couple of days now and I haven't found anything to complain about.  The band is highly adjustable for any size wrist and it feels natural.  The clock was easy to set and all of the sensors seem to be working well.  The display is easily readable from pretty much any angle., Even though it's a men's watch I bought it for my girl since she likes big watches like myself and she loves it. And for the price I couldn't pass it up., Just what i wanted., Great looking watch with a large face. Has good weight on it. Looks like a very expensive watch. I get many complements when I wear it. You will love it!, excelente, Cute and dainty.  I got one for my 4-year granddaughter also, because she liked it., Watch the mail is poor, Excellent, I really like this watch. I love everything about it. I was surprised when I accidentally hit the watch against a metal corner and it suffered no damage, it's very resistant. I think the digital watch display could be a little bigger, but I'm okay with it., I bought two!  I have  7 and 9 year old granddaughters. It runs really large,.... perhaps for an adult size wrist. I'll have to take it to a jeweler to get it sized. But, it's a quality watch., Beautiful watch!!!, cheap looking, It's beautiful. works well,  with a charged battery!, This is the fourth watch winder box combination I've purchased through Amazon and they have all met or exceeded my expectations for quality and value., Happy with product, inexpensive and works well., This watch is just as pretty in person as it is in the picture. I bought this for my daughter, she loves butterflies. This is a sturdy light weight watch. It works well, and is great for everyday use. Highly recommend., It's ok. Picture looks better., This watch was purchased for my mother-in-law who LOVES butterflies! Due to it not being Amazon Prime eligible it did take a couple weeks to receive. However it was well worth the wait. The butterflies are beautiful, my favorite is one on outside of the watch, its raised slightly and the stones are beautiful especially when the light hits it.<br />The face of the watch has great details, stones around the face in place of numbers, and beautiful detailing on the butterflies.<br />The band itself needed several links taken out in order for it to fit, which was not difficult at all. Love the fact that the size of the band makes it possible for it to fit on all sizes of wrists.<br />Nice quality watch, which is expected from the Geneva brand. I own several of their watches and will definitely purchase again!, I love this watch. I thought the face may be too large, but it's perfect and easy to read. The adjustable band allowed for a perfect fit., GreatA+++++++++, Excellent style, quality and versatility, Too small for the Swatch Irony. I recommend buying a sport band and cut notches with a Dremel Tool instead., Excelent, this supper cheap pos was an awesome gag gift, The color is off and I'm not sure but the watch isn't working., I like watches, my only choice in men's jewelry and I'm very fond of this watch!  I had watched the price on Amazon and hesitated buying it hoping it would go lower but they raised it to full retail so I did not buy.  Kept checking and one day found they had finally reduced the price so I quickly purchased it.  I really wanted an all black watch and honestly I had been looking at this Fossil for about six months.  Nicely constructed chronograph with silicone band and clear crystal.  Looks good and I'm glad I bought it!, I just don't understand why three of it will stop...if you have any answer for this please forward it to me because when i check the net i can't find the exact answer of it., It is a nice watch, it came early than expected. Its comfortable to wear, I think its neat how the hour is on top and the minutes are on the bottom. The only thing I wish it could have had was an instruction manual. I didn't know I was suppose to cut part of the strap off to fit my wrist until I had to look up a similar item just to read the reviews to see how it works. Other than that its nothing to be dissapointed of. Its water proof, tells the time and its comfortable., Seems shorter than most bands. Leather is not the quality that I expected., This watch has unusually large links so sizing is almost impossible.  Uncomfortable watch size it's either much too big or too small and can't return.  Don't spend your money on this watch!, It seems a little cheap and I'm having difficulty with adjusting the time, but it's a nice watch all the same. It's good for 5 bucks, especially!! As far as accuracy to the anime goes, it's great! I love it. Let us see how durability treats it, though. I'm going to go easy on the chain and I'd suggest you do the same., I really like this watch, once I hit 40 my eyes started getting bad and this watch is easy to read, it does not have all the bells and whistle of more expensive watches but for me I like a nice simple watch that is easy to read and looks good, and you can't beat the price.<br />I would not hesitate to order this again,, This was my grooms gift to my husband. It's beautiful but the battery dies every 6 months., Purchased for my wife, she says it's very pretty and works well. I agree it's a very nice looking watch perfect for small wrist women. Amazon took a full week just to ship it, can't imagine how they could provide a reasonable excuse for that., I love this watch it is even better looking than the picture and so far it keeps perfect time.  This watch runs very small as other reviews have stated which is why I purchased it, I have tiny wrists (6&#34; inches) so it fits me perfect.  There is no way to adjust the size so if your wrist is larger than 6-1/8&#34; I don't think it would fit. Update - I have had this watch for a few months and it's still keeping perfect time, When first researching this brand, I was worried because there is not a lot of history or information available on this one.  And there is a dearth of information on the various watch blogs and forums.  So I originally began looking around for a more established brand that had this same face.  To my surprise, I could not find any other watch that had these features.  Plus, at this price, I figured it was worth a shot.  So I bought it and I am pleasantly surprised with my purchase.<br /><br />I love the crystal, which has a slight dome that subtly distorts the watch face when looking at it from an angle.  But the dome is not big enough to be noticeable in any other way.  You may be able to see it in the video, but even when looking at the watch directly from the side, it's difficult to tell that it has a domed crystal.  This adds a touch of class in my opinion and I love it.<br /><br />One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was that the larger subdial at the bottom is the regular second hand for the watch (easily missed in the video if you're not looking for it).  The large second hand attached to the hour and minute hands is actually the stopwatch second hand.  So the large second hand remains stationary until you press start/stop button on the upper right.  This is another subtle feature that I love and can't find anywhere else.<br /><br />As others have said, the watch is big.  I tend to be happy with anything between 44mm and 48mm, so this one suits me just fine.  It is extra thick at 13mm, but nothing that gets in the way of regular use for me.<br /><br />My only complaint is that fold over part of the clasp has a little too much play in it for my taste.  I almost feel like I could accidentally catch it on something.  It hasn't happened yet, so maybe my fear is misplaced, but I think I would feel more comfortable if it didn't have the fold over clasp for safety, and instead just used the push button clasp by itself.  I'll probably end up switching the band anyway, because compared to my Citizen, the band feels cheaper.  And I feel like I may be able to add some character to the watch with a leather or regular NATO strap.  I will edit this with pics when I do.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this watch and it will be a part of my collection for quite a long time.  And Burgmeister is now on my list of approved watches.anyway, because compared to my Citizen, the band feels cheaper.

And Burgmeister is now on my list of approved watches., excellent, Good quality, big watch.  If you have a small build this is probably not for you., Just replace it and it was easy to replace thanks., A very nice reissue of a watch they made in the 70's. The crowns don't screw down. The one for the inner bezel has a good snug feel and  the bezel stays in place. One disappointment is the lume. It's weak and doesn't last very long. Other than that it's a beauty.<br /><br />Bob, A niceaddition to my bands., Man, this watch is awesome.  Very high quality it seems.  So far its the best watch I have.  I wouldn't trade it for anything., A fun watch that I like to wear onstage . It always gets attention., Screams for attention. Solid build. Rather heavy - useful in hand to hand combat...;-)<br /><br />Has its own charm., Looks good on the wrist. Nice blue dial., This is a nice-looking, casual watch. It has an attractive leather band which seems like it will be durable. It’s easy to read when telling time since the numbers and lines are large. The day and date are also easy to see. As expected for this type of watch, it has a second hand. Also note that the watch does require a battery. Nothing fancy, but good for an everyday watch., Totally disappointed. It came broken and unraped!, Love this watch . All the functions are correct . Very nice quality for the money. I recommend this to anyone. Another nice feature is the watch band size was large enough to fit my wirst and  have it sized., Arrived earlier than Amazon predicted.  The watch is very cute.  Batteries were working upon arrival.  It's a little bigger than I expected, but I like it.  I wish there were number ticks on the watch someplace, because due to the size it's difficult to tell where the hour hand is pointing.<br /><br />I received at a discount in exchange for an honest review., Well made with no sharp edges and easy to open/close., not the tight size, Perfect fit. For casio, Very classy, purchased as the perfect gift for my brother! Absolutely loves it! Now I may need to get one for me!!!, So far so good! Ordered this with one day shipping at 85$ next day it's on here for 52$ so sending it back to replace my order for the better price. G shock killer? Only time will tell I sent my g shock back to order this one and glad I did, better built seems so anyways also the most comfortable watch iv owned fits very well idn why ppl rag on it being hard to read the face in low light I never have an issue and besides has a great light for night that glows the Whole screen also compass works great spot on all the time when the alarm sounds the light also flashes although when using the compass I noticed be light flickers while compass is in use idn if it a malfunction or supposed to do that but all in all for 50 bucks it well worth and would definitely buy this again great looking feeling and over all a bad a$$ watch for what u get couldn't go wrong!  UPDATED 4-5-16 Still 5 STARS this is truly a g shock killer in my option best watch by far iv owned I never take it off I'm rough on it each day and not a scratch on it never a hiccup one fits like a glock. Just bought my fiancée engagement ring from Jared as I'm waiting on it to be sized a saleman try's to sale me a 600$ citizens Eco drive watch have to say was a sweet looking watch but honestly wouldn't stand a chance taking over this bad boy so my words of advice buy this watch with out a dought u will not regret it!, My boyfriend liked it. :) It looks like in the picture., Perfect!!!, Beautiful piece of jewelry!, Okay, This must be about the lowest end of Wenger watches, but given that, it seems fairly sturdy and dependable.  Not exactly what I was expecting, but for the price I kept it for my son., This is not all leather.  The inner material is some type of foam plastic that cracked within weeks.  This think will only last a few more weeks.  Can't believe that Timex would risk there Brand name with junk like this., Excellent quality, Fantastic.  I am a watch nut, buff, enthusiast, collector.  I dream watches.  The box this watch came in is fine furniture.  The watch is cosmetically as close to flawless as it gets.  I have a thick wrist and this watch band was still larger than I needed for a comfortable fit.  Fortunately it is designed for easy link removal.  This watch weighs like a feather.  It is a large watch but I believe it would still be attractive on a female.  It really weighs almost nothing.  I would be the first in line to hold hands with a woman wearing something like this.  I still remember women wearing &#34;mod watches&#34; in the late '60s - early '70s.  HUGE metal kabob looking things, to go along with their mood rings.  Well, here is your new mod watch.<br /><br />I don't want to leave the impression that this is not a masculine watch.  It is, but it would look great on anyone.  If you put this on and go out in public, expect to get hammered with questions, comments, compliments, etc.  If you'd rather have conversations about the weather, politics, sports, then put your Timex on before you step out.<br /><br />I know that the price may seem excessive for wood.  I stopped spending on watches some time back.  Other &#34;things&#34; are more important.  Initially I was concerned about the wood, and what effect normal body moisture might have on this.  Humidity and high summer temperatures are ridiculous here in Arkansas.  I know this watch will weather well.  I took it to my watch guy at our local jewelry store for his opinion.  A little old man behind a thick glass window, and an electron microscope contraption strapped to one side of his face.  He's squinting at me with his free eye.  &#34;What is this, you bring me?&#34;<br /><br />I have too many watches.  I have a four watch winder box that looks like it was manufactured by a piano company.  Russian watches, an old Omega, a really old beaten Breitling that is so heavy, I could sooner win an arm wrestling match with my left arm than my right.<br /><br />Honestly, I am not employed by any company whose product I review.  I am in no way affiliated with Woodie Specs or any other company that I post reviews for.  This is simply my personal opinion.  And if I could wear non-prescription sunglasses, I'd be wearing wooden ones, most likely from Woody Specs.  I'm almost ready to wear a broccoli tie and brussel sprout cuff links., I like the band.  Used it on my Invicta 8926.  Wasn't crazy about the ND Limits table but not a problem.  As stated in other reviews, not very flexible but overall a very good band., Very happy with the product unbelievable that can deliver for such a low price. Thank u., This is my second or third DaLuca nylon strap. They are definitely the thickest nylon straps you can buy. A bit pricey, but you'll notice a difference compared to lesser expensive straps. Only complaint, they're not soft like some others, however, they are more comfortable than an original strap. I used this one to replace the bracelet on a new Seiko Diver watch. It really lightened it up and feels more secure. Yes I recommend DaLuca's., Almost perfect. The only fault I see is that the light does not work on other modes but the home mode. You cannot turn the light on while on the alarm, timer etc. modes. I'm keeping it, can't ask for more for $39., Sweet, Nice looking for the money. but too shiney for my taste. I prefer a matte look. It keeps good time and is easy to read. The bracelet is long and can be adjusted. It will fit almost any wrist. I really like the combination of gold and silver. I hope the face is scratch resistant., I bought this watch in june 2015 a couple of times wearing this watch while taking a shower and the Timex stopped ticking !....its now a piece of junk and I'am out my money., Nice box it comes in and really like the look, Nice watch but noticed that would begin breaking after only one month the crown broke after two Days, now two screws in b the band are loose and the winder piece is gone.  overpaid, even with the discount, Love it, have recieved many compliments on how stylish and colorful it is .. plus the best part is, it's for a great cause., You can not go wrong with a Swatch watch.... and horses!, For all dog lovers!  These make Fantastic gifts!  Works well and it's just Fun!, This watch is so pretty!, date is kind of small even with the magnified glass bump, had hard time to chagne the date too. but to tell time it's great. and it's waterproof!, Very user friendly watch. Large digits are easy to read while training. Only wish it had an average pace on the data save mode.,, Looks so expensive. It runs like a charm!, The only complaint that I have with this watch is that the weight may take a little bit of time to get used to if you are not familiar with wearing a heavier watch.<br /><br />The Swiss Legend Men's World Timer Collection Stainless Steel Watch arrived at our home in a cushioned box with a protective sleeve that immediately had you thinking that this was a quality product inside.  If a company is going to spend so much on the packaging then the watch inside must be a show stopper.  We were NOT disappointed in this watch.  Remove the sleeve and open the box and you have a stainless steel watch nestled in a soft black velvet fabric.  The watch is covered with a protective film that needs to be removed.  The watch has a five year warranty that you simply have to register your investment and you'll have additional protection if something happens to your watch.  The watch is comfortable to wear but be aware that it weighs 16 oz.<br /><br />This watch is a show stopper!  It has:<br /><br />Swiss Quartz movement<br />Water resistant up to 330 feet<br />Sapphire- coated mineral crystal<br />Polished black ion-plated stainless steel case and band<br />Chronograph functions: 60 seconds, 30 minutes, and 1/10 of a second subdials with date function<br />and more!<br /><br />Instruction book included, It works fine so far (but that's no proof of anything.) But the band is kind of shoddy. There's a leather strip over the holes that already has it's blue surface scraped away. That's really only visible to me mostly, though, so I'm not that upset., exellent, I bought this watch while living in Hawaii right after becoming a mom, I wear it in the ocean, during kids' bathtimes, in the pool, and while I'm sleeping (so when kids wake up in the middle of the night I can find out the time without shining a bright phone light). I have worn it almost constantly for over 3 years, only taking it off to shower and when really dressing up. I wear it to church and out all the time. I am just now going to have to replace the battery for the first time. This watch was on sale when I got it for $19 and has been one of my favorite purchases. I would pay much more for it again., It looks really cool. It's going to buy it for my brother., Watch band functions well.  I had to replace the pin holding the clasp to the band soon after I got this because it broke off.  The pin is actually a little bit too big for the clasp so have to bend the clasp a bit to get it in but I did manage to do it.  Been working fine for a month or so now., Great watch for a smaller wrist. I have looked a long time for a watch that would fit me will. I finally found this watch. It is super easy to read and very comfortable on my small wrist. I use it every day and love it., cheap looking, Fantastic watch for workouts and &#34;mom on the go&#34;.  Exactly what I needed!, Excellent light weight watch. Great button feature that quickly changes from 12h to 24h., It looked like the picture but felt somewhat flimsy and cheap when I put it on.  Although I got it for a deal, I ended up sending it back., Bought this for my wife (13th Anniversary).  Priced cheaper than Zappos and Macy's, this was a no brainer.  Product was just as advertised, except that it looks way better in person.  Very classy watch for a classy lady., perfect, I bought it as a gift for my mom and she likes it a lot. Very pretty design and looks just like picture, I have hd this watch for a year now and it decided to stop working on my. But I'm not one to be afraid of tinkering so I just removed the back and replaced the batteries. There are two batteries (maxwell is stock) I bought Duracell 377 for the smaller battery and c1220 for the larger battery. It works like a charm again. I love this small watch because it does not get in the way during clinical rotations as a nurse. I can pull it up and clean my hands thoroughly without worrying about it being in the way. I also like the light for evening shifts, I can see the time perfectly. It was worth changing the batteries., The watch in an all black color with dark numbers and dark dials Hard to see time, Battery was dead on arrival., It works for me, Great looking watch that is easy to read, set, and get to all the functions. But after a 30min swim in a 6ft pool the watch died. The notes on this watch says water resistance is rated to 100ft but my watch is now dead. Would have given it 5 stars if it didn't get water logged and died., To big and bulky for a small arm. RETURNED, Love Seiko alarm clocks, The clock is great as the past Braun alarms have been but the door has fallen away from its pins.  We are very careful with it and have never dropped it or abused it but the tiny pin that is lodged into the housing of the clock pulled away because the plastic area where the pins are attached failed and the small hole that holds one of the pins is now a slot so the pin slips out and the door falls off.  I will not buy this product again due to the defect in manufacturing.  There must be a better way to keep the door on the clock., I really enjoy this rose gold hardware watch. It has a clean classic look of a watch and it doesn't break the bank. I was a little unhappy with the leather strap at first because of all the cracking, but it's not noticeable because there's no peeling coat on the leather., Had to get two links taken out to get it to fit right, but it's perfect, be aware that the pins split once they are pushed out of the links, the CAN be pushed back in, just don't lose them if you are DYIng. A nice balance between masculine and feminine. It both goes well with silver jewelry as a &#34;wear-out&#34; piece and as something you can wear with a business outfit. Comes in a very nice box. The lack of any tick marks by which to read the time can be a drawback, but to me this is more of a jewelry piece than a watch that I rely on for exact time measurement. Fits solidly on the wrist., Best travel watch!, Better than I thought. I usually wear Velcro watch straps, but this one is as good, if not better., High quality very beautiful, For the price, loses 1 minute every week., Another nice Seiko 5. Made in Malaysia (NOT CHINA OR KOREA!). Much nicer in person. The dial is more of a medium dark beige than the photo shows. The strap is just plain ugly. It's not cheap, the color is just awful. Swap it out for a NATO/Zulu or a nice leather and it's much more appealing. Out of the box, one little shake was all it took to start it up. I've come to prefer my Seiko 5's (7s26 & 7s36 movements) over my more expensive watches. I think it's because of their simplicity and reliability. Twice a day I take the time to shake each of my Seiko's for 40-60 seconds, and they've never stopped running. Accuracy? Just fine right out of the box, no break in or &#34;setting in&#34; time needed for them. To a potential buyer: if you don't know anything about these automatics, research them before buying so you understand how they work. Otherwise, you'll end up thinking you bought a watch that is defective. Simply put; these are great watches at ridiculously low prices. You'll learn they run for years with no maintenance.  I own both the SNK's and SNZG's. If you think the SNK's might be a bit small for you, check out the SNZG's. They're larger, but have a similar look. Both are nice military style watches. Watch came in a blue Seiko box with white leather-like pillow, original owners manual, and Seiko warranty card., Came with one wrong pin. I bought this as a backup up to an earlier one. Pins very brittle. Quality varies greatly. The first was one was very durable. Luck of the draw on this one., It's a cool looking watch but i had for two weeks and the battery died so i went and bought a package of batteries for it and it didn't work, This is a beautiful timepiece. I haven't had it very long but so far I love it. The feel is solid, the look is clean and the price is right for a high quality Swiss watch. I know there is a lot of debate about the wisdom of buying luxury watches on line in the grey market rather than through authorized dealers but given the great experiences I've had with Amazon in the past and the fact I'm saving $1,300 I'm at ease with the trade-off., Beautiful and practical. I love it. Maybe the instructions for set the hour is confuse, but not impossible., Good one liked it.. but little heavy, This is a beautiful watch! I've bought two as gifts, but wish I had one for myself!, Very comfortable, Doing the job so far, very stylish waterproof and shockproof, I have one for work in construction and another for the party. I recommend it 100%, Item tarnished.... returning, I order 3 of these watches. they look really cheap. really really cheap., Awesome. I used to have the larger 46mm small second full titanium but sold it because titanium scratches sooooo easy. This one is awesome. Be warned screwa are loctited in so bring it to a jeweler who knows what theyre doing. Absolutly geoorgeous timepiece. Its my daily wearer. Highly recommend it. Pics do it no justice. Ceramic bezel insert is stunning..., I like the watch a lot. It looks great and is a replica of a the Rolex SUBMARINER GREEN DIAL. The watch wears fairly light and easily will get you some compliments. My only flaw with the watch is that it is not 100% water proof and that is why it gets 4 out of 5 stars., best smart watch I ever come across. worth the money., LOL &#34;Adventurously designed&#34;? Jesus Christ this thing is ugly., I LOVE MY WATCH! AWESOME FIT AND THE PACKAGING WAS AWESOME!, the clock has a spot on the board. Please attention testify against product quality., I ordered 3. 1 didnt work, One of my most faithful watches. I take it to work with me every single day and it never gets damaged or barely gets any dirt or anything on it at all. Very truthfully, worth the money for this Bulova., Works great. Nice look and finish. Accurate and easy to read. The button at 2 o'clock will change the day of the week and cannot be locked. Sometimes the day gets changed unintentionally. I still rated this 5 star as I think that is a small problem. One quick glance and I get the right time. Still my favorite of my 14 watch collection., Compared to my other Invicta watches, the display itself is too small for my liking., the watch is ok but like a lot of other people has commented it is extreamly dark and if you are a bigger guy like myself it's going to be a tight fit, Yet another addition to my collection of Invicta watches. all are exactly what I want in a watch without the high prices. Several of my Invictas I have had for several years. Still work perfectly., so cool, exellent, This was a disaster from the time I opened the package. First, the molded plastic container was broken. Second, the battery was dead! To make matters worse, where it's to be opened broke while I was holding it. NEVER AGAIN!<br /><br />Edited: Sept 6...  I'm still puzzled at the thought of receiving such a SUB STANDARD product. This has never happened before regardless of what item I'd ordered. Truly, the poor quality control of receiving this watch (if you could really call it that) in such horrid condition, indeed,was a shocker. It was beyond disappointing., Quite small. Was really disappointed. I haven't used it., Beautiful watch however the gold tone metal is wearing off. Figured it would wear with time, but watch is only 2 months old., It fits nicely and looks good but three of the holes have broken since I got it and I've had it less than a month., I got in a bike (as in bikecycle) crash on the way to work and my wrist scraped across the road surface.  I was wearing this watch, though, and it took all the damage like a pro and, thankfully, much of my arm remained road-rash free.  The watch got scratched up, but continues to work fine.  Two months after that I went SCUBA diving in Pensacola with this watch.  Went as deep as 110 ft and the watch held up just fine, despite the damage its accumulated from my bike crashes and general wear and tear., It's beautiful, Don't fit on Motorola Moto 360, but I adapted for this watch, Beautiful watch.  Fits well.  One of the few watch brands that considers that some of us have very small wrists. Many other brands can end up either halfway up the arm or over the hand, making any type of activity difficult.  Thanks to Caravelle New York and Amazon for carrying these hard-to-find watches, particularly at reasonable prices., Brand new fresh battery.  Rated at 1.55V.  I received and tested at 1.58V., I love it I wish they also have white with this model, Casio's women's watches in this series and the Futurist series cannot be beat. They are small but easily read, keep perfect time,  have fantastic colors, and I so far have 4 of them, so you know how much I like them!, The electronics in the watch for what ever reason started to constantly beep every twenty minutes for No reason.....what up with Timex  quality control !l, Excellent, This is a kinetic watch. They are discontinued by Seiko. So this is a very old Kinetic watch. It doesn't work and chances are none of this version of the watch will work. There is a capacitor inside which is charged by motion. If it has sat for over a year and not been worn that capacitor discharges and cannot be recharged. I know I have had two of these watches in the past which no longer work.<br /><br />It's going to cost me $75 plus tax to get repaired by a local jeweler. I suggest of you choose to buy this watch you will need to do the same. I didn't return the watch because I wanted it and the Jeweler assured me after the repair it will be as good as new. The original price on this watch was almost $500 so it was worth fixing., Great watch!!! The black and blue looks awesome together. Very eye catching. Many people mistake it for a G Shock because of its shape and size. For $22 you cant beat the price. I wear it to my work at a Hospital ED, lift weights, swim, run, and wear it out on the town. The band is thick and durable as well. They sell the same watch at JC Penny for $34. Buy it from Amazon!!!, Exactly what I wanted!, I returned it was to complicated to set and you had to add number to get date and time! Not for a child at all, unless you have an advanced one#, ThIs watch may look really nice but it most definitely not a $465 price tag quality like it says upon delivery.  Got this during prime day for $48 and I even feel now that might have been to much. The band that you wear on your wrist is cheap rubber material that actually snapped in half in a month after buying it during regular use (actually while I was asleep) just be cautious on what you &#34;think your saving&#34; when the the sale price is exactly what it's worth, bad, Okay, After losing my very nice daily driver I was skeptical to spend so little a watch after having grown acustom to a fancier one, but this is a solid timepiece. The quality of the strap is exceptional for the price and the watch itself it attractive and of an appropriate weight.<br />This is such an awesome way to class up an outfit for under $30.<br /><br />Great buy. Would highly recommend!, DOA!!!, Smaller watch then I  thought. I found better watches at a better price. It is a little cheap looking but does the job.  Very few  extra functions, but  band is comfortable.  (it's okay...), Nice product great price, I would like though that there where a photo/picture with an actual women wrist to imagine the size, this is a gift for my wife and it is to little., Very beautiful and luxurious and high- quality, I was happy with the way it looked, but the unfortunately band and loops seem to be cracking after only a few months and will need to be replaced with something else soon., The watch was as described and depicted. It is a little on the large side.  An elegant, reasonably priced timepiece with a little historical German flair., I am really hard on watch bands, I have been through 4 in two and a half years with my current watch.  So far this one is holding up really well, exellent, Always wanted one of these until I received a Casio Wave Ceptor as a gift 10 or more years ago.  While the Wave Ceptor is a nice watch (I still like it) it's a digital/analog that has radio-controlled timekeeping and is somewhat complicated to operate...but it still works great, though.  I feared that this one would be difficult as well.  However, I quickly realized it is very simple to use.  I'm very pleased with the size, shape, operation, and features, etc.,etc..  You can't really go wrong with this model...or any other Casio in my experience., I love this watch and so does my boyfriend. It came in a MK box with booklet and had a price tag stuck to the back which was partially scrapped off. Another price tag is strung to the watch as well. It is an authentic product and I am very happy with my purchase., This thing is a beast!  I have it on a Suunto Core. The other reviews that say stuff about durability are crazy!  I'm in the military and am frequently out in &#34;the field&#34; and wear this every time.  Sweat, sun, HEAT, wear, dust, etc. nothing stops this thing, and it still looks fantastic wearing out to dinner with my wife., Swiss Legend watches are just beautiful, durable time pieces and this one is no exception! I especially like that I could remove the links with a small screwdriver myself and didn't need to take it to a jeweler., I bought these to make some static wrist straps as the elastic bands at work were quite old and losing elasticity. So far they've held up quite well, but are somewhat scratchy at times., I love it! I bought the gold first and liked it so much I bought the silver. I've received several compliments. My husband at first said it was ugly and now he think it looks cute. It looks retro cool and can be dressed up or down. So glad I got them!!!!, Watch is as attractive as advertised. It keeps perfect time and I have received numerous compliments on the look and style.<br />I would not hesitate to buy again if necessary., awesome, I bougth this watch but it come with the watch crown broken, Returned it the same day, UPDATE<br />I am taking a moment to edit my original review. I did give the item 5 stars at the beginning, however I have dropped my rating to a 2, the reason for this is the third time I wore the watch/bracelet combo, the bracelet strap snapped in half on me. Judging by appearance this item appeared to be made of good quality material, appearance isn't everything unfortunately, the quality is just not there on this item.<br /><br />Original Review<br />Perfect watch to pair with a nice pair of jeans and boots! Nice leather band easy to fasten. Button enclosures, fastens with two buttons one on the band and one on the bracelet band. The bands are attached but do snap closed separately. Does have two options of buttons so you can get the best fit possible for you wrist size.<br />Nice quality, rustic looking with nice detail., Beautiful timepiece., Bought it as a gift for my brother since he loves Deadpool<br />And he is very happy with it<br />Thank you for cooperating with my delivery, Worst thing you can buy on Amazon! Feels cheap is cheap!, Amazing watch. Fits perfectly on wrist and the clock part itself isn't too big nor is it too small. It looks sick and adds to your style., Just what I needed<br />Nice, compact and has all the tools needed!!!, Excellent watch, I fully recommend it!, I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review. I am beyond disappointed in this watch. One I open it excited and it blue, royal blue not purple at all. Looks nothing like the picture not only that it's ex cheap material and would not fit on my wrist this looks like it it could fasten around my neck?!?!?! Yea that big around the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the watch does in fact work which I will be taking the watch and attaching it to a band that actually fits around my wrist. But highly Do Not recommend this product unless you want It have a watch on your neck., Screen broke and I couldn't repair. Repair cost was more expensive than the watch itself, This was a gift for my 13 year old son and I never noticed it until he pointed it out yesterday.  The watch face is completely off center.  If I'd know I would have returned it but now it's past the cutoff.  He said he thought it was fine before but we can't tell how it could have turned....and can't get it to move now.  He is dyslexic so I could see him missing it in the beginning?<br /><br />The watch is pretty heavy but my son likes it that way and the color is his favorite.  Wish I could give it more stars but the face being off is a deal breaker!!!, This watch is my first 'swiss made' ETA valjoux 7750 automatic movement watch. 7750 movement has a long history behind it and is well known for its good power reserve, precise time keeping and reliability that could last a lifetime. Compared to other brands that has watches with 7750 movements like Hamilton and tissot which falls around victorinox 241620's price range, come with a 'day display'. But in my opinion watches other than digital watches, may not need a day display and date display is sufficient at analog ones like the one we have here at victorinox model. This 241620 model was launched in 2013 and the looks of this one is awesome. It derives inspiration from swiss army air force and has the same logo on the bracelet clasp. Military time is printed as well on the face of the dial. The look of the watch on the wrist is beautiful and the dial is just about the right size 42mm. The dark grey dial looks stunning in contrast to the silver bracelet. The chronograph function is just as a default 7750 movement's one - a12 hour counter, a 30 minute counter and a 60 seconds counter. The watch is a little heavy at around 200+ grams but you cannot help it as all the watches with 7750 movements are around this weight but on the wrist you don't really feel it heavier. I would recommend this watch to anyone, who would love to own a swiss made watch with an automatic chronograph movement that has this legendary movement - 7750 (stood the test of time - during quartz crisis) combined with the stunning aviation line up from victorinox. Go grab yours before the ones sold and shipped from amazon.com, at great discount, gets out of stock., I gave this watch to my boyfriend for Valentine's Day about 2 years ago and he absolutely loves it, this watch is truly what it claims to be, such an elegant accessory for any man., VERY NICE AND SLIM LOOKS VERY CLASSY. MY SON LOVES IT.  ONE LITTLE PROB IT SEEMS TO LOOSE 2 MINS IN TIME PER WEEK ON AVERAGE. BUT FOR THE PRICE OF A SWISS MADE WATCH STILL AN EXCELLENT CHOICE., About 1&#34; too long for my adult small to medium size wrist but still very usable: when worn on the wrist, the &#34;tongue&#34; sticks out a bit which I doubt will be a problem. It's comfortable. Thinner than the original Casio resin band which broke in 2 places after a few years full time use. Can't complain b/o price below $10. Easy to place on watch using the existing pins and a small penknife blade. Tip: remove and replace pin with the back side of the watch facing you b/o more clearance., This is a durable classy looking watch. The chrome edging on the face looks awesome and accents the red very well. It is my most accurate watch and I use it for work and in the gym. It has come in handy many times. I work in an Emergency Department and knowing what the exact time is can be very important when documenting., Perfect watch!, the strings on the sides are always coming off and always having to cut them off, Watch quit working. Only keeps digital time., Watch is junk I sent it Back, IT,s a TIMEX Nothing else needs to be said except:<br /> IT KEEPS ON TICKING ,  Those That Do not Know the Saying ,, Oh well, The way this watch was photographed I didn't see the circle of crystals surrounding the dial (they are really bright). Purchased this for my son. The flashing lights are amazing and multi-colored (and they don't blink constantly). The quality of the watch is fine, but it is clearly for a female even though masculine in style. For the price it was a great deal and the proprietor is most anxious to please the customer. Would have given a 5 star review for quality and customer service had it not been for that detail. A very handsome and useful watch otherwise. I probably didn't read the details in my haste to purchase it at a bargain price. Would be an excellent purchase for a girl/woman who likes to bike/walk/run after dusk. I'd use it myself but my son likes to play with the flashing light feature., Just okay, Excellent, It seems like a bad finishing work, I honestly think this is cool giving the fact it is super sophisticated and looks a bit antique and after getting it I didn't expect it would be small, this is my first pocket watch so I don't mind. Still it looks in ship shape condition, I just got it and I like it., Absolutely love this watch.  I've been looking for a casual watch for awhile and this is perfect.  It's fun colors and bold face really stand out.  And the large face and numbers make it easy to read, even without glasses!, I've always enjoyed the Gshock watches, but have been disappointed with the straps.  They always seem to be too long.  And shorter replacement straps or strap adapters are impossible to find.  This stainless steel bracelet is easy to adjust for a perfect fit, and, as a result, I wear it much more often., Beautiful and smaller than I think it was. Perfect for smaller wrist., Really easy to set  use, and is soooomcool to look at.  G, The strap hurts their wrist., I bought this for Steinhart ocean 2 and absolutely love it. The rubber is high quality. It's a little more still than I anticipated, but that's okay. It will break in., Excellent for the money, Mt niece likes it, As you know, this is the second watch I have ordered. I am well pleased with it. It keeps accurate time. It is very dainty and<br />the intricate work is beautiful. I had a friend at our senior center that liked it so much, I decided to order one for her. It is a<br />necklace that I am proud to wear and I have received many compliments on it. Thank You., This watch is impossible to set!  It is NOT user friendly at all and the directions that come w/ it want you to look up the instructions online but the website that they give you to find the directions to set the time and date are not even for this watch!  One more reason for me to hate Adidas!, Works as described by seller and manufacturer. Bluetooth synchronization with Casio+ App was relativily easy. On the other hand, synchronization with third party fitness apps was a little cumbersome...In general everything is working as described and simplifies my workouts since all important data is represented in the watch without having to look at my iPhone located at my armband...It also enables me to play, pause or skip my music tracks directly from my watch..., my son wore it one day and washed his hands and the paper came off and the screen went blank.The seller was great though, refunded my money immediately.. so I bought my 4 year old a &#34; big boy black water resistant watch!, Quality Purchase, Worked for about a week. Then stopp watch function mis worked- the second hand does not reset to zero and neither does the minute hand.<br />Otherwise ok ?, Excellent watch. Wonderful little bit of 80s nostalgia that's also as imminently practical today as it was when these watches were all the rage. This is Casio's best plastic band and will fit a fairly large wrist. The face is easier to read than many of the classic models. The indiglow would be nice, but the corner light works fine and is much easier on batteries. Very fond of the  Casio chime on the hour.  Programming is easy and intuitive. If you are looking for a practical watch with a bit of Reagan era flair, you won't be disappointed., Looks and feels nice, but starting to wear out very quickly at the fastening point., This is my first watch purchase in years. For the price, I think it is very comfortable & handsome. My one wish was that there was a date display on this watch, but it's not a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />COLOR: The picture is pretty true to how the color looks in person. I don't think the &#34;rose gold tone&#34; looks brassy or cheap (if anything it is not quite 'pink' enough for my taste). But it matches just fine with my other rose gold jewelry. I do wish Fossil had the rose gold metal color option for ALL of the leather colors... but alas.<br />SIZE: I have a small-medium sized wrist, and I am currently wearing it on the 2nd-to-last hole... so the extra band is a bit long. But it has one of those extra loops to hold the extra band. People with small wrists would probably be out of luck. The face is about as big as I would want. The hands are very easy to read.<br />BAND: The leather band is very soft but sturdy, and I really appreciate the comfort of having the leather backing behind the watch face -- it's never too cold, or tugging on your arm hairs!!<br />QUALITY: I have only had the watch for about a week, but the quality of the watch, the leather band, and all the fastenings seems very good to me. The clasp does not come undone during the day., I bought this for my 13 year old nephew. i just received it. It looks very strong and well made. the sieze is perfect. I use to be a Timex rep so are know the are one of the best inexpensive watches out there. I am 99% positive that my 11 year old twin boys will this watch also., Exactly as described and just the right size.  Not too big as the other g shock's tend to be too large for my arm. Wristband is gray instead of black., interior quality poor my watch is expensive and I did not trust  the plastic holder, Bought this last year summer (2014) it was inexpensive (paid $15.49), had good water resistance, and had the protector bar. I tend to be a little rough with my watches so honestly the protective bar was the selling point. It has stood up to a cruise vacation, pools, showers, landscaping, washing dishes, and many beach trips. Yesterday, I dropped it from my wrist as I went to take it off, onto tile floor. The second hand works but the hour and minute hand move A LOT slower than they should. After 10 minutes pass (by checking phone) the minute hand only moved 2 minutes. The time is WAY off and I can't keep changing it. DO NOT DROP THIS WATCH. Otherwise, it's a pretty good watch for the price. My next watch will be a Casio G-Shock GD-400 and they're on sale right now for ~$70. Oh, and before I forget. The protector/bar - that little piece of metal - is $20 to replace so don't bend or damage it!, very handy, It looks elegant, Ok, Beautiful band, nice heavy leather. Could be a bit more flexible for a watch band., Excelent, This is small in the picture but its pretty darn wonderful in sight. This is a large watch but it is not big like an Ironman watch. The face is 2&#34; in diameter and a little over 1/2&#34; thick, which makes it fairly substantial but not so large as to get in the way. It is not terribly heavy either, which is one minor concern I had until I put it on. It looks good and feels good., Ordered two at once. Both were dead on arrival. Batteries were fine, double-checked with meter. One never started. The other started and stopped within minutes. Nothing I tried to get them to work. Makes we wonder if they are knockoffs instead of Seiko, because everything else I've ever gotten from Seiko was fine., Perfect gift for our 45th anniversary (sapphire and all)!  Love the packaging!  As others have written, the band would fit the largest wrist.  We removed 4 links, and it's just fine., Cute, simple and easy watchband. a little stiff and almost to small for little wrists, I so far have no complaints with the watch. I bought it because I needed a waterproof watch so I could wash my hands frequently at my job as a CNA. I also like that it had military times, because I'm very slow at converting the time. It so far has been comfier than I had expected. I don't think the watch face is too big like others had said, and I have small hands and wrists. I think since others had said it was big I had expected it to be huge so once I got it I didn't think it was too big. The print, however, is rather small and could be difficult to read., Very pretty. Grt value, You get what you pay for. No thrills or fancy doo dads on this... If you're looking for basic and something with a seconds hand on it then this watch is for you. I like it. Only thing that irks me is the face on it is really kinda soft.(think plastic) easily marks and dings. Other than that I recommend it, gift, It's REAL! I needed an extra link, called MK customer service, they verified serial numbers, and my link is on the way for a $4 shipping fee. A few reviews had stated they thought it was fake because there was a sticker on the back of the face. The sticker is for protection and is placed over the engraved MK serial numbers! Amazing watch for such a discounted price! I can't wait to buy some more of these for Christmas presents!, This was my first watch purchase, and I bought it pretty much 10 months ago. This watch is awesome in quality, very scratch resistant crystal (sapphire crystal) , PC carbon case (tough and light plastic). tritium which has a faint glow at night for 20+ years. This watch is still in good condition wearing it everyday, I swam, and did other exercises and no problems what so ever. The tritium is faint, but you can easily see it, I like how its not outrageously bright. I don't get much compliments on the watch but for me that wasn't my purchase for getting this watch. I bought it for durability, which this watch is quite durable. This watch also is very good at time keeping, its still only about 30 seconds off after my last adjustment several months back.<br /><br />There are however a few flaws. The GMT function does not work, so you can't keep a second time. (least for me) I followed the instruction manual and tried many attempts to adjust the time but it never worked. If you get this product, expect the second time not to work. Another flaw is the date, it always goes to up to 31. For me its not a big deal, but it may irritate some people. The last flaw is that the compass itself is not top notch. It works but don't expect too much from it.<br /><br />Overall the flaws are not a big deal but its something to be aware of. This is a good watch overall if you're looking for a tough watch this is a good option to consider., Beautiful watch, Works as advertised, Bougt this watch specifically for water aerobics.  Mets my requirements.  Can read the time easily., I like it, Perfect replacement ,as the rubber bands dry out and crack, beautiful, high quality, quite and priced right.... comes with cloth to cover the box and packed nice with watch tools for simple repairs and adjustment of your watch straps... will buy another two for my other automatic watches, This is my &#34;everyday&#34; watch. It's simple yet stylish, if that makes any sense..., This is a well constructed though heavy analog watch.  It has an eloquent and classy appearance.  I'm not a big fan of analog watches, but I have to admit that there is certain appeal about this watch when you're in a suit.  The few negatives that I have are the date window is small and oddly positioned, there's no back light....the hour and minute hand do have some phosphorescence, but the hour markers do not.  I set it and monitor its time keeping in relation a clock that links to national time standard.  Any lost of time is minute that I couldn't detect it over a week plus...I like that.  All  in all...a very classy and well constructed watch., Very attractive band but the leather is not flexible enough to adjust to smaller wrists., Sleek & stylish. Quiet as advertised. Better than expected for a reasonable price., It is the original part., For the amount paid for this watch, I was very pleased. It is dressy without being gaudy., Excellent!, Impossible to read in low light., I bought this item as a gift and to my chagrin this watch stopped working within 6 weeks of purchase. I am very disappointed that not only was I fooled into buying what appeared to be an expensive and well made watch, but there was no way of getting my money back or a new watch once the return window was closed a month after purchase.<br />I work hard for my money and to lose it in this way is nothing short of theft on the part of Giftstreet.  I will never buy any products from this affiliate of Amazon and I will deter any one who may consider this company.<br />p.s. strap isn't secure, hands on watch are touching and falling over each other......., Just fine, The strap hurts their wrist., The buckle broke the first time I wrote it., The watch is nice and very goodlooking but not nearly water resistant as stated. After spending a bit over one hour in water it condensed and stayed condensed for 3 days. After that it took it no more than 2 minutes of being in water to condense again., It is so beautiful😍, Your product seems to be fine.  I ordered this hoping it could help me get a really stubborn back of a watch.  It didn't but i was only hoping.  I will keep it and use it for others., I've already worn it for a week and absolutely love it. I have small wrists and I think it still looks great! I bought a Nautica marine watch last year but had to return it because it was 5mm larger than this one. 10 year batt, 100m resist., Tide graph, moon calendar, dual time, 3 alarms, stopwatch, analog/digital, with an orange led light...the perfect watch! Extra thanks to Acacia Grove for prompt shipping and a genuine watch!, It works perfect and doesn't look cheep. I did have to make a new hole to have the band tighter  and the triangle came black not silver like it shows in the picture. Other than that I love it!, Garbage.  Broke when I tried to use it., can't go wrong for the price you pay !, The Burei BM-7003-01A is a decent and modestly priced watch with excellent timekeeping and good chronometer functions.<br /><br />The face of mine differs from the product description; the face is black, not white as shown on this page.<br /><br />This watch is not too bulky and keeps excellent time. Users with large wrists may find the stock leather band slightly too small.<br /><br />The included user guide could be *much* clearer.<br /><br />I'm not a daily watch wearer, but understand that grownups sometimes have to wear one to complete their look, especially when dressed for \\\\\"serious\\\\\" appearance. This looks just fine with business attire and is not ostentatiously bulky.<br /><br />You can spend thousands more, but this will tell you the time with precision.<br /><br />Nice watch...I sure wish the user guide had not left me in a state of confusion.<br /><br />Note: this item provided for review purposes., It was an exact match to the one that came with the watch. very strong and easy to put on. I wore the original for more than three years and it began to smell so I got this new band. They shipped two new pins for it as well. I'm very pleased., It's a nice looking, well made product - but flawed.<br />I would easily rate it 5 stars, but the holes are too small<br />to accept the Seiko &#34;fat&#34; pins. Much too small.  Some<br />lube or otherwise would make no difference in this regard.<br /><br />In its favor, Hadley Roma does provide 2 (slender) pins.  But if<br />part of the reason you bought a Seiko diver's watch was the<br />security and solidity of the heavy duty original &#34;fat&#34; pins, this watch<br />strap is not for you., This watch is a baby watch.<br />Please don't be fooled!, Bought this to replace batteries on two TAG Heuer watches ... tired of paying $30 bucks for jewelry shop to replace a $2 battery. Also bought a plastic, adjustable watch holder to make it easy to hold the watch while turning the back cover off.<br /><br />After adjusting for three slots, the cover came loose with a simple turn. Really nice to have the correct pegs for the TAG Heuer slots. Simple to tighten back on as well.<br /><br />Great little tool that paid for itself 2x on the first use., I received this watch in perfect shape. Some one must have set the time before it was sent out as it was right at 6 hours off, set for GMT time. So that to me was good news since it had been sitting for 24 hours before I picked it up, or that was just perfect luck that it was set to GMT when I opened up the package. The leather strap feels good and is made of genuine leather and I think will work for me. So, today we will say the watch is perfect in all points. If I find later this not to be true, I will update my post., I got gray cover and did not taste much, I was looking for a medical alert tag for a chain necklace. This caught my eye. After reading the reviews and figuring the size. This met my needs. I could wear it like that. Then I had a brainstorm. I wondered if it would fit on my anklet. I wear one all the time interchanging when my mood changes. Their between 2 to 5mms in diameter. I knew that the tag would fit on the smaller ones. But the 3 and 5mms ones could have a problem. When I received it. The O ring used to attach it on the anklet was small. But why not attach it on the spring or lobster clasp. Perfect; I solved the problem twofold. Any diameter of an anklet or chain could be used. Some people might not like it attached to the clasp. It works for me. If you need to wear a medic alert tag. You now have this one to use on a neck chain, bracelet or anklet. No matter what diameter. I highly recommend you think about this. Then possibly get one for your needs. The tag was delivered in 4 days. Nicely packaged. So consider it. You can't go wrong., just use 2 weeks and the clock pin is broken., I really like the colors grouped in 15 second blocks which makes it really easy to use for taking vital signs.  It also has glow in the dark second hand.  The date is a little hard to see, but the rest of the watch is a nice size.  Military time hours are very small and not the easiest to read, but if you have very young eyes, this watch would be perfect., This watch is stunning.  It looks a lot nicer in person than in the pictures.  As with any watch that has no markings, it takes a bit longer to get the time but my wide doesn't seem to mind this., Arrived much earlier than predicted from Russia. I've owned 3 Vostok watches now and this one by far is the best. Vostok fixed many of the quality control issues. Even the band, although still sub par, is much better than past incarnations of this watch. Great, reliable, affordable, unique, quality automatic watch. What more could you ask for?, This watch sucks, all the pins are loose. Its poorly made. The pins keep falling out, Perfect fit.  Made my old watch with worn band look like new., Was exactly what I was hoping for it to be, This was bought as a backup watch to stand-in for my son's Casio G-Shock while the band was being repaired.  He tried to put it on his wrist and the back fell off.  It is a press fit back and not a screw-in.  We can't fit it back in and this happened after the 30 day return period.  So we are stuck with a pretty but useless watch.  I seriously doubt that it is waterproof to 100M as advertised given the ease with which it falls apart., It looks really nice, I bought it as a birthday gift for my bf but I can't find any guarantee paper inside the box., Wow... am I impressed with this watch!  I have fancier watches of course, but I needed a watch that I did not feel guilty about to just wear and abuse.  I don't really like quartz watches at all, so when I heard about the sistem51 watch last year, it really piqued my interest.  I didn't get around to ordering one until recently though.  First impressions, it feels cheap (because it is...) but still sturdy and elegant looking.  The silicon straps are comfy and look good!  The watch face itself is simple and clean (some of their other designs can get wild though).  The automatic mechanical movement works flawlessly on the watch.  What is truly amazing is what Swatch is doing in my honest opinion though.  Luxury and quality should be made for the masses, and this product clearly is a product that is supporting that notion.  Of course, what I mean by luxury is the mechanical movement.  My only complaint might be the lack of any quality materials that is used (everything is plastic...) but that would drive up costs.  So I do understand the reason for sticking with all plastic... but honestly, I would not mind if they made a slight more sophisticated version with other materials., High quality very beautiful, Back always falls/pops off. Could lose the back piece easily. Yes, it has the rubber &#34;O&#34; ring on it., It's too shiny and looks cheap.<br />Would have been nice to have a better picture of the band., I bought this watch as a replacement for my father in law whose Timex finally gave out. I was worried about it fitting his wrist. I was very pleased that it fit quite well. He loves it. It is high quality and appears durable and perfect for what he needed., I have had three Timex Ironman watches over the past 10 years.  I continue to purchase the watch for its features.  I do a lot of interval training for running and the Ironman's 100 lap feature is great to record times for every interval.  I also travel extensively and use the 5-alarm feature as my primary alarm clock.  I also use the event timer in a non-stop loop to remind me to do a repeated task every hour when I'm busy doing a second task.  For features, I really like the Timex Ironman watch.  The one drawback occurs when the battery is discharged.  The watch seems to be ultra-sensitive when I open the watch myself and change the battery.  After replacing the battery myself, the watch will randomly short out (reset all functions including the current time).  I'm sure the water-resistant feature of the watch is also compromised after I change the battery myself.  Changing a battery shouldn't be a big deal; there is probably some simple thing that needs to be done to ensure the battery is seeded correctly when replaced., I am satisfied with my purchase, it's just what I wanted., Very nice watch. The only thing I don't like about it is the traditional second hand (the large one) is only active for the stop watch function. I thought the small second hand above the six o'clock position was for the stop watch and it was only accurate to one second, which would have been just fine for me. But that is not the case. The small second hand is for the time. The product description lead me to believe otherwise. At time of purchase, I was unable to find a review that clarified this. Otherwise, this is a fine watch., I chose this watch because it looked similar to a Michael Kors watch I fell in love with but was far too above my budget. I love it even more now! I can depend on Timex to have a quality watch at a price I can afford. I work at a hospital so it is imperative to have Military time a glance away. The design is simple yet elegant. The band is light and easy on my wrist. This watch is perfect for me and just as pretty as Michael  Kors watch!, Wish the top was glass, like the watch, but don't ever think you will be able to use it after the sun goes down, or in low litght - no useful luminesence, and a light that gives you hope you'lk be able to read the time, but it ain't never gonna happen!, Love this hard to find watch for a women. The band is a little short but still a great work watch., Does the job very well, Love it! As mentioned in previous reviews, if you have a large wrist the band may be too small., I llike this watch band.  I am handicapped and have limited use of my hands.  I am able to put my watch on easily with this band.  I recommend it., fair enough, I am watch click door I love the watch little bit small but I like it, i love my watch. it was a really deal for the money. it is much lighter than expected. like a feather. the bracelet design is so beautiful, looks like many chains sewn together and it is quite unique design.the adjustable bracelet made me really happy because i have really narrow wrist., I bought this to wear to work.  I work in a hospital and wanted to &#34;bling up&#34; my scrubs to give them a more feminine look.  It works.  I like the glitter and the price makes me not worry too much about loosing it.  I have a problem with the fit.  It's either too big or too small depending on the number of links I take out.  Other than that, no complaints at this time., The watch just arrived yesterday and spent some time playing with it. Love the watch. It's easy to set up and love how light it is. Also, I have very small wrists and the watch still looks great and feels very comfortable. I took off a star because all four screws are loose to the touch, that is I can turn them with my finger nail. I intend to call Amazon to get a replacement watch and will update my review then., Works for what I wanted it, Much more beautiful in real, Great watch!  Looks sharp. It comfortably sits on the wrist although it felt a bit heavy at the beginning.  Easily adjustable band; you just need a small pin, and a lite hammer.  I purchased it before going on a 3 week international business trip.  I traveled through three different time zones and the watch did the job with the easy time zone adjustment. The alarm could be a little louder.  Also, the watch does not get the radio controlled time signal at my house (Staten Island, NY).  It does get it when we stay at my in-laws up north in Pennsylvania but I'm keeping it a secret from my wife as she would probably want me to get the radio signal more often..., Very bad!!, I think this band is amazing for the price. I love everything about it. Only one problem.  The clasp was bent when I got it. I've tried to mend it myself and I got it pretty good. But the hold is shaky at best. It was packaged pretty well so I'm not sure at what point it got bent. But it will do for now., This is the worst watch that I have ever purchased.  Very poor quality.  It's already running slow.  The most annoying thing about it is that it ticks VERY LOUD.  You cannot place it on a nightstand or anywhere near you if you are trying to sleep., Perfect, perfect - I love it - seriously great service, packaged well and a beauty when opened!, It's the best, I have had this watch for just over a month, the battery was had a low warning when I received it.  I didnt have the time to return and wait for another one.  Now the battery is completely dead.  The batteries in even my cheapest watch last at least a year.  This is my only complaint., Just as described and cheaper than at any nearby store!, Perfect, Now I can fix my own watches wish I had this a year ago just got to learn how to use all the tools but still better not to be over charged to have the work done., Exceptional watch, If you have big hands (and you are a guy) do not get it, it looks like it was made for girls., pure and simply bling - oversized, heavy, and I'm sure Flavor Fav would approve - 200 meter water resistance will test it in the water park (only costs around $50) - sapphitek face (I assume is harder than my Disney World watch face) - and it still keeps time even though I only wear it when hangin with other 50-something poseurs LOL, NICE LOOKING WATCH, BAND WAS A BEAUTIFUL RED BUT WAS WAY TOO SHORT AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK., This is an original, with clean lines and perfect design., Awesome watch, mine just had a slight defect on the 9am/pm click that showed up like a piece of white plastic. I was trying to wind the dial also, but wasn't able to wind the watch. Was able to set the clock using the dial though., new and i liked, The reviews complained about setting it, but if you follow the right directions, most should be able to set it. After that, it's a great watch. My 7 year old loves it, has been timing things and wears it all the time., Beautiful watch. Very substantial. Wish it had a little more bling...but it's elegantly subtle., Nice watch box. It has some details in the box, like little scratches and the division of the space inside is not so uniform, but it will work., Excellent, I have had this watch for 2 months now -- absolutely great. No problems at all. Didn't think the band was too stiff, it was fine. The watch itself has to be a little thicker -- that's where the solar cell is. Excellent value.  I do miss the indiglo/light up feature, but none of the solars seem to have that. Probably too much for the battery. When not wearing it, I keep it on a table facing the window that is bright, but not direct beams hitting it. So far, all is good. Only had to adjust the time when it first arrived.  I would like to see it with a black band, a little more dressier.<br />Hopefully, in a few years we will have a wider choice of solar watches available. One has to wonder why we are putting batteries into our landfills when this is available?, Nice watch, particularly like the day/date function, so hard to find in a women's watch.  BUT,  it is VERY heavy and strangely-shaped. It wants to sit on the far outside of my wrist, so I have to turn it toward me to read it EVERYTIME.  Strap is soft, but the keepers are not anchored, so they move and the end of the strap sticks out.  Most certainly not worth the $495 price tag on it.  Just barely worth the $40+, I paid., Purchased just for the deployment clasp, its the best!, The parts are well made, I would have preferred the face to be a bit larger in diameter., The watch is fine but the band is useless.  The pins keep working themselves loose and the bracelet opens dropping the watch and link-parts to the floor.  It has done that 3 times while just wearing it.  Assuming you can find the pin and the parts of the link, it's easy enough to put back together, but obviously not an ideal situation and also a bit embarrassing when your watch falls apart on your wrist!  I guess I need to find a replacement watch band as the watch itself is fine., This watch has last my husband through day in and day out of hard manual work. Great watch. Exceptional quality., Beautiful, large face & looks very expensive!, When you put it on the watch it didn't stick too well it continue to come off so I got rid of it!, Beautiful, Worked flawlessly and easy to use., The watch is exactly described. Very quick shipping. Came with the original warranties and everything nice, A really fun watch;  great summer color;  keeps perfect time and I can tell the time without my reading glasses!, Looks a litte cheap, I bought this for my daughters 18th birthday gift. She loved it! It's stylish and works great! The price was far lower than the department stores. It came in a very nice box and everything that you would get in the department store. So glad I found this one., Well made with no sharp edges and opens and closes easily., Very unique watch I am retarded because it's too small for me but these beautiful, This watch is exactly what I wanted<br />:)<br />- Just like the picture (Maybe a tad more matte/flat than the picture) (Looks even better in my opinion)<br /><br />- Everything works properly<br />):<br />-  Minor scratches on first link (Bought new) just like many other people said<br /><br />Overall: 4.9/5<br />Everything is how I wanted it to be, looks nice, great price, looks better than my brother's $150 Guess watch, it was a little too big for me. Spent $10 to adjust it at a shop and it fit perfect (Obviously not the manufactures fault, for the price I bought this it wasn't really a big deal)<br /><br />Clean design and look, definitely would recommend., The watch is terrific and lasts a long time. I've used a DB-37H for years. The only problem is the resin watchband which breaks after 3 years of continuous use. But the band replacement costs $15-16 and a new watch costs $18 so it's a simple decision to buy a new watch!, Was delivered yesterday.  Pretty decent quality, comes with 4 different types of fitting inserts.  Has 3 total contact points,  I could only use 2 as my fossil wasn't  big enough to allow the third round engage the notch on the back.  Great product for those like me who would rather do it themselves than pay a jeweler. Would definitely recommend, One of the best watches, I purchased on Amazon.  This is a very nice and rugged looking watch. For the price it's<br />Worth a buy. Both the analog and digital compliment each other. I have seen other watches with Analog and digital face. But this watch looks like a expensive one. 5 STARS. Definitely a watch to have if you are a watch lover. ; ), Still testing the acurary but after month of use , all I can say by far one if the best gadgets I now own., My husband receives a LOT of gifts purchased from Amazon! This watch is wonderful, bold, masculine, eye catching and can be read easily. (His 60+ year old eyes have trouble seeing the time on digital watches.)  It is rather large but he is a big guy and can handle the look, if you are slight or medium build it may be too much watch.  The only issue so far is the battery had to be replaced after less than 2 months but as he said we don't know how long the battery was in the watch prior to purchase.  Quick delivery, beautifully packaged, inexpensive compared to watch prices in stores that were not half as attractive.  Great purchase!, Package is very good. Worth the money. It would be 5stars if the clasp were not so tight, had thought time opening it. Hope it loosen a little over time. Only feature missing for me is missing the days., Amazing watch. Looks better than in pics., Having issues.  Who do i get in touch with to make the repair, The watch looks a lot better in person then the picture!!!!, Nice, but I can put it on without unclasping the band and I have an 7 1/2&#34; wrist.  Will need to take it to a jeweler to have several links removed.  I guess that's better than trying to figure out how to get extra links., It's amazing, Watch the mail is poor, will be sending back, cannot figure out how to set month and date., so beautiful - thank you., Did not like the watch . HEAVY and BULKY., Very beautiful and luxurious and high- quality, exellent, I love this watch! It's so pretty and looks just like it's pictured. The only drawback is that it's a bit loose on my wrist so I'll need to get 1-2 links removed but all in all an excellent watch!, Arrived as shown in perfect condition. Beautiful watch!, Getting tons of compliments on the watch the first day of wearing it. Truely unique design., Pros:<br />~Works as expected,<br />~Beautiful minimalist look,<br />~Well built<br /><br />Cons:<br />~Needs resizing - possible to do yourself, not hard.<br />~Sometimes the time is off.  Most of the time the clock is on, and working great, however sometimes it changes by a few minutes wither forward or back.  Once it had been off by several hours, although this hasn't happened since., piece of crap, got water in in the very first day, and I was just pooring!!, So far so good.  Love the look and style of the watch.  Its also very comfortable.  If it holds up well I plan on buying another for camping., I love that this watch comes with 2 catches because I have small wrists.  All I had to do was unsnap one catch and it fit perfectly.  This watch is made really well with a very secure catch.  I have gotten so many compliments on it.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a watch that looks like it costs much more than I paid here for it., Was received in poor quality and NOT in new condition. Should have gotten it cheaper, rather not go through the mission and let you know I was lied to., I read reviews but I don't do them myself, but I will review this one the watch is beautiful., Bought this for boyfriend who had this exact watch many years ago and loved it. This one stopped working after a few weeks. I sent it in to Casio for replacement parts, worked for another couple of weeks then stopped again. Piece of junk! Don't buy., Low quality materials (what do you expect spending 5 bucks?). Display doesn't even work correctly. That being said, I still like the &#34;alien&#34; look, so I'll keep it., It's like a junk watch very cheap materials., exellent, Perfect fass delivery, Very nice.  Wish it was easier to remove links to make it shorter.  Not sure its possible with this bracelet.  Would be great if they could engineer<br />this to be easier to remove links., I bought in 30 june. But i just use watches in 28 july. Final it becam in water n stainless. I feel so hopeless about it. This is gift for my husband, Awesome for any celtics fan!, Vey attractive not too large pearl face. Good looking bracelet (I was looking for chrome and gold) and didn't want a large chunky look. So far the timekeeping has been fine and I am altogether happy with the purchase., Great automatic for this price point. Good power reserve (about 36 hours) and accuracy within +/- 10 seconds per day. Later saw it $50 cheaper on Jomashop, so not happy about that, but Seiko pricing is pretty variable. Would have preferred white (no glare) dial over silver., Beautiful, classy watch, I bought this because I was tired of feeling so reliant on my phone for little calculations or to see what time it is. Now, I feel a lot less chained to my phone and it is wonderful. The display is clear and easy to read, and the strap doesn't bother my skin. The buttons are small and take a little getting used to, but that is to be expected because the watch is not overly large. I was worried it would be too big or bulky on my wrist, but it is the perfect size for a wristwatch. Will certainly buy another if something happens to this one., perfect, Nothing like the original. Lighter weight material and shorter in length. Feels cheap., Thanks you it came faster than the set date and it looks amazing, I broke one of my straps on my LG G watch... this was a pretty cheap replacement. They work perfectly., Vibrating alarm works fantastic.  I need it because I have to wake people up in the middle of the night ,so they can go to work.  A normal alarm on watches I can't hear ,because of there tone,but the vibrating alarm worked everytime.  Occupation, corrections officer., I received this watch and when I opened the package, all I could say is &#34;wow&#34;. This watch is awesome in every way! It definitely has the look and quality of a much more expensive watch! I have several Invicta's and this is definitely one of my favorites already! You wont be sorry if you purchase this watch!!, It's a terrific watch., Durable value that looks good while your swimming.  Kick up your favorite outfit with a little inexpensive to apply<br />color!, Awesome watch,my second one too,the strap broke after two years on the other shark I had so I got this white one and love it more than the last, Looks great - especially paired with this band - the only disappointment is band scratches. 100 meter water resistance, Served its purpose well in an austere environment.  The straps lasted about 3 months a piece.  Cheap enough not to care about throwing away once it served its purpose.  No issues with watch face.  Easy to see the watch face in low illumination., Rolex Daytona-looking watch; not exactly but fairly close. Invicta however, is a good brand that stands on its own; so there is no detriment to the sporting a look-a-like version of he Daytona., I own many watches some very expensive for occasional use and this is my favorite everyday watch, I have this in a lot of colors for work. I love it. Completely water proof, has the date and is super cute. Not too big, not too small., Amazing, stylish and small., The watch is a definite conversation piece--everyone comments how cool it is. The band is small for a nan's wrist but large for a woman's. I don't know if links can be removed as there was no documentaion/booklet accompanying the watch. The clasp is very difficult to operate. The watch is cheaply made--don't expect it to last long. I paid very little for it so that's fine. And, as I said previously, it is a real conversation piece. It's a fun piece of jewelry., Just like the picture., I like this watch. It has become one of my favorites. I own too many others to list, but when I think it could have a wider bracelet and clasp. I remember that I can sleep with it on. Others are too uncomfortable. I get compliments on this one while $2K watches g0o unnoticed. Built almost as good as my Omega... maybe better as that one needs $300 in repair or more., beautiful, It is not water proof. When I washed my hands water came in, I had to pay over $24 in order to get cleaned, Lasted all of 1 month before breaking., Not atomic., I am completely satisfied of this simple and elegant design.<br />My wife really like it., Work for my dad, Even better in person than in the photo.  Comfortable and keeps perfect time!, Everything came as expected  very happy with size and ease of operation  of warch, Quite nice for an inexpensive time piece, Wrist band can not be adjusted beyond 3/8 inch. So to wear it is sloppy and useless, Very cute, but it (the strap) broke very quickly., Sent first one back because the ball part fell out of the ring part. Got a replacement and the same thing happened.  Poorly made., Got this watch for my son as a graduation present from Air Force BMT. Defintely worth the money I paid for! Very durable and beautifully presented in its box! It's a large watch, which suits my son just fine! He absolutely loved it, as well as his MTI!, A little light and the face was hard for my husband to see. Nice looking watch though!!, I love it. Better than i expect. It came at time. Thanks!!<br />Sorry for this late review. I'm from Venezuela., When I first opened the box, the watch looked fantastic and people thought I spent nearly $100 on it. However within 10 days water got under the glass and condensed on it and consistanly looks foggy making it difficult to read and looks bad. The glass can not be removed to fix this problem. Also the finish is wearing down and tarnishing quickly., So far so good, I didn't counter any problems with this product. It looks like 200dollar watch but it only cost 22 dollars. Only complain is the format of digital gauge which states: hours/seconds/minutes, Was a gift for my daughter, and she loves it!  Very fast shipping...thank you!!, Looking good and really expensive. For the first time there were some problems with second and minute hand (they used to go faster or slower), but in 2 days everything went okay. Maybe the mechanism got used to my wrist moves.))<br />Awesome, worth buying!, For the price of these watches, I expected them to be cheap-looking and feeling. They serve their purpose,as of now they're still working and no damages yet. Not too bad for its price, I would say. I only got what I paid for., It's a good looking watch and the multiple dials do indeed work. However, the smaller dials can be difficult to read and the glow feature doesn't emit a lot of light. If the arms were the same color as the hand, it would be much easier to read. All in all, it keeps time accurately and for the money, you can't go wrong., Broke pretty fast, I'm happy with my present from my husband., Description said it had a unidirectional bezel, but it does not move..band also too short., Seems well made feels good but product does not come with instructions and i cant look up how to set watch and tell the time on it. Looks cools tho, I like this watch a lot. It stays wound for a whole weekend and has a durable metal watch band. I've been using it for 10 months and it's my go to watch now. Only complaint is that there is not enough color contrast between the watch hands and the background gears. Not a huge issue for me, but I did take off one star because of it., Easy install, fits perfectly, and it's actually an improvement on the watch, since it seems to resist the smudging from fingerprints like the bare watch face easily gets., Slim, comfortable, attractive, easy to read, and never needs batteries. And it's a Seiko. What more can you expect in a watch?, A very solid watch all round. My eyesight isnt amazing which has made it difficult to set the watch but I suppose my next purchase will be glasses! I would highly recommend this watch! I am a happy customer!, Arrived just as shown in pictures, I like that the display doesn't waste area on crap like seconds twirly wheels or maps of the world. The date is large enough to read without a magnifying glass like the display area wasting watches. I didn't give 5 stars because the band is VERY difficult to resize. The instructions that came with the watch didn't mention resizing! I had to go to the web and found a YouTube video that showed how to remove the clips holding the segments together., awesome little set, everything i need, There is no question that the winder functions well; I do have some serious concerns that the rotations will scratch my two most expensive automatic watches because of the plastic watch inserts rubbing against the plastic slots during rotation !  Given my limited navigation skills,it would be appreciated if you would forward this message to the product link of the manufacturer !, I normally do not wear a watch, but I found a need.  My iPhone's vibration for incoming calls or text messages just isn't strong enough to always get my attention.  Using a watch that can vibrate on my wrist sure fixed that issue and this Casio (for it's price point) found its way to me.  Many of the &#34;poor&#34; reviews spoke of the blue tooth being to week.  I don't know why they are stating that because the range for me has been awesome.  I can plug the phone in have way across my house and I'm still getting the notifications without fail.  The only reason I'm giving it four stars is due to the fact the blue tooth isn't native.  You have to have the Casio App running at all times to keep the connection.  In a way, the app has it's high points ~ gives you additional features if you set it into Music Control and you can designate keys on the watch to perform functions.  It also integrates with other apps on my iPhone like MapMyWalk, and I can then use the watch to show my split times/distance/etc. without pulling the phone out of a pocket.  For those that are running and have their phone mounted on their arm this is sure to be a huge plus.  Not sure if the app is native to the phone's blue tooth, but still it works.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the watch.  Wish I could give a Half Star to have it lean a bit more to a five., The outer ring of the clock does not line up with the rest. 9 is wrong and in 60 of the crown is a defect. The second hand of the clock will not be aligned properly. I contacted the seller for a replacement. This picture shows everything  Edit: Now the button for resetting the clock is depressed and no longer start.It sucks, maybe it's not even original. Seller uncaring, absolutely not recommended, Watch was okay,but watch pens kept coming out while fastening the watch, Hard to program.  Directions are incorrect!, The item is so heavy and bulky...totally not  good at daily wear...plus... The compass doesn't work well...just have no reason to keep it and take 2 weeks to get refund and the as the action from the seller is so slow...didn't get full amount of money I paid without explaining why...definitely would not recommend..., The leather band is high quality.  The bezeled edge surrounding the face gives the case class.  The shape of the hands catch the light, no matter what direction it is coming from, making it easy to read the time.  This watch is going to fit right in with my classic black performance attire<br />., worth the money has all the bells and whstles, The case on this watch is absolutely astonished. i have had several friends comment that it looks just a submariner from 5 feet away, but when you get closer you see the invicta logos. great quality case and the movement is beautiful, 6 ticks a second, compared to 8 of the rolex. My only gripe is the band, the clasp is A1 but the links feel light and cheap, they also scratch rather easily. I recoomend a new band if you want this as your daily watch, a black nylon/rubber band would also go well with this model. All in all a great watch fro 90 bucks and if you are thinking about getting the watch, you should!, Good coloring, matches my LG G Watch R pretty well, so I'm happy in that aspect.  The downfall of this is specific to people with hairy arms/wrists like me.  Beware of the occasional pinching of your arm hair because every edge on this watch band has a somewhat &#34;cut&#34; edge, aka - they didn't really refine the finished product as far as smoothing their edges and parts on the actual band.  This creates the ideal opportunity for hair pulling.  Also, the clasp is a bit unusual in the way it latches, however you get used to it quickly.  The overall price vs. quality outs this a notch above the rest, because you really can't find a decently made band with this good of a color profile for this low of a price., Perfect, love the weight of the ceramic & it's easy to read. Elegant and not cheap-looking like many rose-gold items can be. Very nice and keeps perfect time., I've gotten more compliments on this watch than any watch I've ever owned. However, the post that holds the latch closed broke off in only 2.5 years, so I'm only giving it 2 stars because that's not a very long life. Fossil wanted to charge me almost half of what the watch is worth to fix it., The chime is nice and I like the night sensor function that does not allow the chime at night. The look is elegant and classic. Seiko is a reliable brand to trust. I like this wall clock., My husband had one like it and lost it and had to have another one.  Many people admire it when he is wearing it., Just received a Reactor Gamma as a gift. Very impressed with the high quality design and materials. This watch is well balanced, strong, light and beautiful in it's design with the decorative etching on the centre of the links, crown and around the bezel. An all titanium, day/date dive watch with tritium tubes and rated to 300 metres. Special attention has been given to a unique fastening system securing the titanium watch band to the titanium case. Even the case back is heavy duty in it's design and comfortable to wear. Something you don't see in many higher priced watches. It has got to be one of the best rated luminous watches on the market, even the second hand shines brightly. The Japanese Quartz movement is accurate and reliable. It fit my wrist with an additional two more micro adjustments straight out of the incredible case I use as a stubby cooler for my beer. Just another example of the thought gone into designing a time piece anyone would be happy to own or receive as a gift. Fortunately the watch was purchased before the Australian government introduces a Goods and Services Tax on &#34;all&#34; items bought off the internet, coming soon for those of us living &#34;Down Under.&#34; This watch is beautiful, reliable an at an incredibly affordable price. I would recommend Reactor Gamma to anyone looking for a great titanium, day/date dive watch that's &#34;Never Dark&#34; to read. P.S. Fakes are in all brands these days. Watches should only be bought from an authorised dealer or reseller to insure authenticity., This watch is elegant, sleek and very stylish. It was much more than I expected., This watch died after about a year, but it was on the wrist of a very active kid and took a lot of dirt and abuse. The strap held up very well as did the body of the watch. Something inside malfunctioned ... probably got mud in there somehow... and it locked up, killed the battery and died. It didn't last as long as we'd hoped, but for the money, it did a great job. I'd buy another., I bought this watch as an anniversary gift for my husband.  The actual watch wasn't nearly as pretty as the picture showed.  I returned it immediately and received a full refund., Like the watch overall but it was shipped with a defect. One of the three small aiguilles fell off., Only watch I own and wear. Never really been a jewelry guy, but I got a wedding ring not too long ago so this matches that pretty well I'd say. I get a lot of complements on this wrist-bound chronograph too. I guess some people think it makes me look grown up or something., This is a very good watch.  keeps EXCELLENT time and looks a lot more expensive than it really is.  Can pass for stainless and real gold and diamonds.  Really.  Would make a very nice gift for any woman.  Can be dressy or everyday.  That's what I love about it.  Even went swimming with it for minute or two and no problem., Unbelievable bargain at $69.00.  Better than anticipated., The watch was too big for my wrist. I gave it to my daughter and she probably will like it. I wish it was a little smaller face and band like the<br />previous Geneva watch I ordered., Great product, especially at sale price. I've gotten lots of complements in a professional setting (healthcare) and wear it almost every day. The band was originally fairly large, but it was not particularly difficult to remove links myself., Bought this as a gift for my daughter and it literally stopped working within 45 days. I even took it to a watch store to have the battery checked but they couldn't even get it running again. Too bad it's past the return date., Beautiful watch with the heft of a quality timepiece., It revives my Kinetic  Seiko. So far, It works wonderfully..., Great value. Looks sharp. Mine was a bit scuffed on the non-clasp end when it arrived. It's mostly gone now and not noticeable. It seems to scuff somewhat easily but a bit of mink oil takes card of it. It's also more narrow at the end than the photo suggests... i'm guessing it's 20mm at the end but i'll try to measure and update this. My photo's make it look wider as I have small wrists. The horizontal thread on the ends by the spring bar looks a bit cheap like it might fray in a year or so. I wasn't expecting a Breitling band for $30 bucks either., This brand new item is defective and is not working properly. I regret buying watch, how on earth a &#34;new&#34; watch can be sold on Amazon and when purchased And received the very next stop working. I am embarrassed., There is no manual operation. When I cross the watch band into lock, but I dont open the lock. So now I can not wear the watch. Can you tell me how to use it by my email?, I have several Android watches, and just like the others this does not disappoint. A nice swiss movement, &#34;wet&#34; black ceramic band, and a 50mm face, the watch is very substantial with nice details. Though large in size, it is very comfortable on the wrist. Overall, a great buy for the money., excellent..., Excellent watch for the price. Looks much better in hand than in photos. Liked it enough to buy a second one. Main sweep hand and all hands on sub-dials are spot on. Might get the orange face version., Arrived quickly.  Watch was a nice size and a nice design.  However watch face mother-of-pearl finish was defective.  It appeared the finish was applied too thin and some parts of the watch face didn't receive the finish.  The result was splotchy and unattractive.  A couple of the rhinestones on the side were misaligned as well.  I wonder if this was a factory second.  It is being returned., I had scratched the face of my watch after bumping against a grantite counter top. Some were superficial and one was deeper over the center of the face that made the face unreadable  in certain light conditions. The product worked better than expected and with 2 applications and heavy buffing the superficial scratches are completely gone. The only evidence of the deep scratch is a slight linear distortion in the face when looked at an angle with the right light., This is an amazing watch and has all the bells and whistles also a large size.  It is a man's Swiss Legend Highlander Display Quartz Black watch that will keep any man on time.  This rugged watch is well made with all the push buttons needed and in a stainless steel case with heavy leather strap.  I found the strap easy to work with and strap on your wrist.  Very slick looking with a large face black in color to match the black straps with red stitching. This stainless steel watch body but has black face with a light red tint to the numbers and markings.<br />Hurry quick to Amazon.com as it is on for sale for $54.99 a sure bargain for this stream lined watch with all the things one needs to keep yourself on time.,  Great looking watch so check it out and look for Swiss Legends 10020-01-RDA a real good bargain., i have been buying this same watch for years. only issue is the plastic band, i wish it came with black leather., Best quality watch ever, Beautiful watch, I can not find them steel bracelet, loved it .. but you can see how the color of real gold looks like and the gold color of the watch 😁.. but even though I recommend it, I liked it, A beautiful watch band that took a nice watch and made it FABULOUS!  Thank you!, loose and floppy.  makes a lot of noise when it dangles on my wrist.  distracting.  Also and obviously, cheaply made., what I expected, PROS:<br />-all the resistances g-shock boasts about (see cons for the ones it doesn't cover since there are too many)<br />-light weight for the size<br />-very clear and easy to read the time for an aviation watch<br />-everything but the bezel is fairly easy to clean<br />-black pvc metal case that holds the watch is very strong (and can scratch other stainless steel watches if you tried)<br /><br />CONS:<br />-face of bezel gets dirty easily (where it says N(orth), E(east), S(outh), W(est) but hard to clean if you like your watches clean (ironically)<br />-the date of the month is difficult to read at first glance, especially where light is weak/absent<br />-glow in the dark is great the first 2 hours tops, there is no backlight either (really wish they did)<br />-not anti magnetism<br />-hesitant to take underwater (scuba) since it is an aviation time piece (so sad) but you can still swim with it<br />(for those who pretty much live in the water, i recommend the g-shock frogman).<br /><br />I work an office job and have received many compliments because it is a beautiful time piece. Other outdoorsmen in my office have inquired about its ability and functions as well., This is a piece of junk. With a little pressure it split apart and the black ring for the handle came apart. I am now attempting to salvage with super glue for both broken and defective areas on the tooL?. I got a free one with a stainless band for an apple watch that actually worked. Apparently, sellers found a way to make another dollar instead of offering added value to the customer. I definitely wouldn't order this again and could not in good conscience encourage anyone to order it. I gave one star for amazon's quick delivery., Impressive looks, heavy and well made. Have received positive comments from complete strangers as well as friends., A great clock with quiet moving hands. Easy to read at darkness., I wanted the reviews about it not being unisex to be false. I wanted the second hand and digital features but it is unwearable. If you have small wrists you will not be able to wear this., I own a 8926ob which is awesome also bought a 9094ob  which is the blue version of the 8926ob  came across  this model  which has a scalloped bezel an smoke gray insert  an it is just as awesome  as the other two pro divers I own also has the seiko nh35a  movement  and came with a dive case an for 49.00 I have to say it's the best deal of it all in my opinion  the automatic  pro diver series  is the best deal period better  than orient an parnis but you already  know you have invicta  haters but I really  don't think they own one or else they would know how awesome  they really are all mine run at cosc levels  an internals are far superior  then the other two brands I mentioned  an yes you can hack and wind unlike the other two brands I mentioned  so if you ever had any doubt  about invicta pro diver line I hope this helps you a little take it from me I've got three with perfect  accuracy  an completely  water proof, Will order again., Good model and nice deal for that price, Beautiful watch like rolex, a little heavy but nice watch, The winding crown fell out shortly after my girl started wearing it and while we found it and were able to get it repaired, it cost us money to do that.<br />Hard to read the numbers so to tell time it could be a lot better (although I'm not expecting much from such a small face.), Very nice watch. Durable and attractive. Only flaw is the top dial catches in my hair if i do not take it off to do my hair and it pulls it., Very, very cute (although it's smaller than I expected on my larger hands). Love the leather, the rose gold, the easy-to-read face. My only complaint is that the chronograph is pretty difficult to figure out (it's easy to accidentally reset it to &#34;0&#34;) and ultimately isn't that useful. Also, a small amount of glue is visible where the decorative leather sits on top of the strap on either side of the watch face, and it's peeling just a little bit. Other than those very small issues, I love it!, It is perfect! The band is so soft and there were enough holes to fit even around my tiny wrist. It is so pretty and in case you didn't know, Fossile gives a 11 year warranty for your watch!, Watch fits well, I love the shinny bezel. The display back is fun and the leather band is stiff but very sturdy feeling. I like this better than the bambino from Orient (but that is a good watch also), The watch was purchased as a gift for a child. Visually, the watch seems to be well made and operative.  What I was not fond of was the difficulty to set the time.  For some reason you can adjust the digital time but not the analog. Thats a bummer, especially for a kid., Beautiful watch. Prices are all over the place when looking online., Very nice, a different color, that looks really beautiful. Perfect for my wife., Cheap but &#34;not cheap made&#34;., Awesome watch, you will not be disappointed!, I work in an a medical setting where I'm constantly washing my hands. I need a watch that can handle that. Furthermore, I need a watch with a big enough display to show me the time and date without putting my readers on. This watch meets both needs very well!, Nice simple watch. Only had it a few days so I can't comment on durability. Only thing that I wish was different is the lugs. Should be able to change the strap., junk, Dissappointed. The baby on the shirt is well below my pregnant belly, at the bottom of the shirt. Not what was pictured., Have two other hilfiger watches, one mainly blue bezel, one mainly gold...this combines them, bluish backdrop, gold outlay.  My new favorite watch.  Looks like it cost 10 times what it did.  The bezel is a bit thick but not overbearing.  Love it., I just received this and it literally smells like someone urinated on it. Otherwise, it seems okay, but now I have to wash my brand new watch., cool watch, Hard to fix time. N belt is little hard to put on hand n taking off. My son is a big fan of paw patrol so I bought it. But not good as I was expecting., Small and portable. I like the flip cover that covers up the buttons when it's packed and opens into a stand when you arrive. I take this on all of my trips now (sometimes that cell phone you intend to use as your alarm runs down). When I'm home, I use it in my bathroom to keep an eye on the time while I'm getting ready in the morning., Good quality. Got several compliments, Excellent, works as well as an original Casio G-Shock. I wanted to try it since I had to pawn my G-Shock and for the money I paid for the original one I could buy four of these. I am very pleased., Got this for my 8 year old son. He loves it. Nice and loud and he's able to play with it. Its like an oversized Lego dude., looks like a much more expensive watch and nobody knows the difference, It is a little big, so more like a bracelet. Very cute., excellent, Looks way different from the picture, Love my new Harley Davidson bulova watch great packaging arrived in 3 days thumbs up to Amazon and Milwaukee Harley Davidson, battery was dead, not the right one, Beautiful daytime watch!, A very attractive watch  with fun features that might work ACCURATELY? I've had it out of the box for five hours and just went to my IMac to contact Amazon for a return slip.Two minutes for the slip, my card will be credited and all I have to do is pack it up and back to the UPS store. Pretty easy. Main problem, you have to hold the watch to your ear to hear the alarm and no adjustment. I've owned many Casio's and I use the alarm system to wake me on hunts and camp outs. Not my ears but the watch. If you need an ALARM, don't buy. Before I ordered I checked the reviews but only checked the first 15 or so. Great ratings. GO DEEPER, past the first 15 as I did to see if my watch just had a bad noise maker. Quite a few comments on the alarm. Of more note, the band gets the worst ratings. Pins falling out, scratches, etc. After thirty days Casio tells you to take a hike as concerns the band. If you like the features of the watch and can live without the alarm then purchase the resin band version with the understanding that the US Navy doesn't issue this unit to SEALS, they would get lost., I'll start my review by reminding everyone this is a sub-$20 watch so I encourage you to keep your expectations in check. If so, this Casio probably exceeds most of them. It's unapologetically plastic, but that is to be expected. Overall, the water resistance is excellent. I had a $200+ Victorinox water resistant watch also to 100 m which fogged up while this did not. Also, for those who claim that the luminous hands don't work, it does. I tested it by closing the door to the basement and with the aid of a very bright flashlight, the luminous watch hands glowed very brightly. However, it does have a tendency to die off as time goes on and may require a &#34;jumpstart&#34; by flashlight every once in a while. The timekeeping is very accurate. Overall, an excellent purchase., Excellent, Classic, simple watch meets my needs exactly., This watch is the perfect mix of dress and sporty flair. I originally bought this watch to be a dress watch thin enough to slip underneath a dress shirt cuff but. Not long I  found my self wearing it casually, however I would not wear it for swimming, working out, or on the job. The chronograph feature is fully functional and captivating every time I turn it on. My one quirk is that it is sometimes hard to see the silver hand over the sun burst silver dial especially in direct sun light. When it comes down to it, this is a beautiful product from Orient for the price. Think form factor, check. Chronograph down to a tenth of a sec., check. Domed crystle, bonus., THIS ONE IS FOR MY FRIEND!SHE LIKE IT VERY MUCH!LOOKS VERY NICE  AND ITS REAL STUFF! THANK YOU SO MUCH!I WILL BE BACK IF I NEED!, SO SMALL! Sending it back., This is a really small watch. It is not 46mm at all. It looks more like baby G-shock. I gave it to my 11 year old son. What a disappointment. Usually G-shocks are huge but this is the exception., Not unlike the similar Invicta watches, the advertised MSRP on these watches is pure fiction.<br />That said, it is a very nice watch, in weight, style and functionality.<br />It also fills a niche, again not unlike the inexpensive range of Invicta watches, it boasts a Swiss movement, chronograph, world time and other features. Mineral scratch proof glass is also a plus.<br />There are some inconsistencies over more higher priced watches, like having a screw down crown, but open push buttons? The description tells you that it is 100m water resistant and that means swimming and showering, but NOT diving, and the absence of the aforementioned non screw down function buttons alone should tell you that.<br />This is an impressive looking timepiece, with a price tag that certainly belies it's quality. People will think it is much more expensive than it is, I have been complimented on it already.<br />I own several Invicta watches, and a Swiss Legend &#34;Hanowa&#34; which I have had for several years, and I would place this watch above Invicta but still in that &#34;cheaper&#34; bracket.<br />I wear a watch everyday, feel naked without one, and being able to wear something that is more than functional, but won't break the bank if I damage or lose it, is a winner in my book.<br />The only thing I would have liked is a &#34;bubble&#34; over the date which is hard to see (especially with my need for reading glasses these days) but other than that I recommend this watch. 4 stars, I believe this watch has featutres most enthusiast would appreciate, for an out door type. The Lcd is legible. The sensors take a little more time to compute than most other casio lines like the gshock rangeman. Go for the titanium, its hardy, durable, and sits sharp on the wrist., Beautiful!!!, I got it to use it with my Pebble Time watch and Apple Watch and love how well it fits my large wrists.  Keeping in mind most watch bands or straps are small on my wrist.  This one felt perfect as far as its size is concerned.  Anyways, I just love the end result.  Reminder for the Pebble Time watch you probably need to buy the bar separately since the strap does not include the bar. The same goes for the Apple Watch, which I needed to use a converter piece, I got from amazon.  Yep I bought 2 straps cause I liked it that much., My third one.  Need to say more??  Just in case, I lost one and I managed to break the glass on the other (freak accident), Watch came broken.  The little knob, to change the time was crooked and it wouldn't move.... so the hands stayed where they were, never moved.<br />It never &#34;activated&#34; the battery either. ....<br />So essentially,  it never worked.<br /> I bought like 4 or 5, forlittle stocking gifts,  the others worked great,  but this one was a lemon.<br /><br />Sadly, I never had a chance to return it.<br /><br />It  Wasnt worth the hassle *or the  cost of mailing it back to China! !<br /><br />So now,  I only buy things that are sold on &#34;Amazon Prime&#34;. I learned my lesson the hard way., I love this clock- as far as the quality goes it's great! The arms and legs move and it's like a giant Lego! My boys love it but both were disappointed that the backlight does not stay on therefore you can't see the time in the dark! I agree with the others that the alarm sound could be louder and be Star Wars related. It's a cute clock but not a night light!, The booklet with the directions is so small I can barely read it. Not only is the print extremely small but the directions are confusing. I have NOT been able to even use it and I've had it for a week. Very disappointed. I even pulled up the directions up online but so confusing., This watch it so stylish and cheap. I don't knwo what else you need to hear. I've had it for over a year and it's survived through all the swimming, and banging, Other than a few scratches, that were completely my fault, it's still good as new. The fact that it can also be backlit is really helpful too., Fraud. Item not as described, Disappointed that after just 2 uses..a already have a broken piece!!  You get what you pay for?!, Super cute and it works great! The gold and white look amazing together and I jut find it so cute, Had another weekender timed watch. Loved it but broke crystal after a biking accident. Kept on ticking though. Not worth repairing so bought another one. This was an exceptional deal. Often see the cost range from $23-$60. Don't know if there really<br /> is any difference besides the band and variations on the face. Never had to replace battery on old one even after 3-4 years. The face lights up when you press the stem. Nice feature when in the dark.  Looks very styish and looks more expensive then it is., It is normal., Great quality watch and super clean. The black stainless steel is excellent quality for the price that you pay. You really pay for what you get with this one, an excellent watch non the less. The orange contrast greatly with the black steel , and comes with a handy link remover that is useful for any watch beyond just this one. Overall  a successful purchase, the presentation is superb, and i hope BUREI comes out with more watches., So far it's lasted longer than a Timex I'd had that was twice as expensive.  I'm going cheap from now on., My grand daughter DIYA was thrilled to receive it., Pros:<br /> * The woven steel band is surprisingly supple and comfortable. It also hasn't snagged any of my arm hair, which I was actually concerned about.<br /> * Clear and easy-to-read face, although the markings and hands could be a little larger.<br /> * Looks slick and thin<br /> * Quiet (I got it because my Timex ticked too loudly). It's practically silent, except once a minute when the minute hand moves.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> * Repositioning the clasp is difficult. I had to use a screwdriver to pry it open and pliers to press it back together. The instructions don't cover this procedure. And my pliers scratched the metal (which doesn't really matter, because you can't see the scratches while wearing the watch). Minus one star.<br /> * The metal band has a row of shallow divots where the clasp can attach. I'm using the shortest setting, about 6.5 inches total length. If you have a smaller wrist, you're out of luck, unless you're willing to risk damaging your watch. (I didn't try attaching the clasp outside of the divots, but I wouldn't recommend it. I was already afraid of breaking the clasp with my pliers.) Minus one star.<br /> * No date calendar (should have been obvious from the picture; I don't blame them for this)., everything perfect I stay well, recommended seller 100%, Of course you get what you pay for, so remember that.  The watch band has to be immediately replaced, as it literally fell apart the first time I tried to put it on. $5 for a new watch band and the piece itself still looKS really cool. Just remember it's not waterproof., bought it as a gift, Not very water resistant but definitely cute and functional., It does fit the Casio MDV106 watch. If you have a sanding drum in a moto tool and the paitence to file down the ends to allow the spring bars to engage the lugs. And provided you have the original 22mm spring bars from your watch and not attempt to use the 20mm spring bars that came with this unit. After a half hour to forty five minute sanding session, the band fits. Once it is made to fit, the band is not bad. Hence the three stars. Yes It was less than ten bucks so what did I expect. Actually the bracelet part is very good for the price., Didnt work for Luminox 3000 series watch.  Waste of money.  Came off in a week, original pins would not fit throug straps.  Had to use the included pins, straps kept coming off my watch.  Useless, Whats not to like, its a overly expensive clock that tells you the temperature of your wall. But seriously, you can get the exact same thing for half or even a third the price. I am a lover of nice things and Braun makes nice things. My clock hangs on a wall that has no insulation to the outdoors. The temperature shown is not the temperature of the room but of the wall., Beautiful, stunning.  See a full video review on YouTube at mainspringreviews., Who needs anything over $20 (Gshock included)? This performs all the same functions, is durable, and a fraction of the cost!, Grandson is so happy with his watch., Watch band broke on the second day, Cheap but, its clear fro, the purchase info, what your getting., Very classy and durable watch! Love it!<br />It will most likely have to be sized to fit your wrist but that is a given with most clasp style watches., It broke the first time it went in the water. do not buy it., I got this watch and liked it so much I got it in two more colors.  It's big, so be ready.  But I like a big face and, besides, this isn't the watch you wear to work with starched cuffs.  Just a great-looking watch that, thus far, has kept perfect time., My daughter bought this for her sister for her 10th birthday and she loves it! It is actually better quality then I thought it would be., Very durable., TOO LARGE AND CUMBERSON, Actually, the snaps wouldn't close, and one of the balls fell off. It wasn't worth my money to send it back, so I gave it away., Simple, accurate, ceap.  what else do you want?, Stopped working in two years., Awesome. If your debating about wether you should buy it just do it, only thing I have a problem with is setting the small minute timer and second timer up... but I'm kind of new to the chronograph watches so it's probably just me, I'm sure I'll figure it out soon<br /><br />Update: over a year with this watch and it's still extremely accurate with only minor discrepancies for the date because some months are longer, it works very well under water still I constantly sumberge it and I still get plenty of compliments all the time, Perfect!!, Perfect watch for dressing up!, Nixon as always has delivered another stylish and rugged timepiece., Very normal, very happy with product, I've had this watch for over 12 years. Very classy look; good weight; hair on my wrist does not get caught between the links of the strap as happens with some watch straps; amazingly accurate. Excellent buy at US $210 in Antigua. I take it off only when I shower or if I go into the sea. I actually wore it in the sea a few times, though.<br />There is nothing wrong with the calendar. As stated by an earlier reviewer, the battery must be changed once the watch starts indicating a low battery (the second hand jumps two seconds). If the battery dies completely you will have to reset the calendar.<br />I've had the battery changed twice and unfortunately I waited too long to change the battery each time and neither of the service companies could get the perpetual calendar going but being a do-it-yourselfer, I found the relevant video on youtube and got the calendar fixed.<br />I highly recommend this watch.[[ASIN:B0007N53ZC Seiko Men's SLL086 Perpetual Calendar Watch]], Nice watch for the money japanese movement a little choppy but overall a good buy., Works well. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it. The band has kind of stained a bit, probably from rubbing on my clothes (I wear it with my navy scrubs). But otherwise, it's good. Adjusting the date is a little difficult though., I am a big fan of mesh watch straps because they are breathable and comfortable to wear.  I'm so happy Timex finally came out with this one!  I wanted a black face background with silver hands, but most other watches of that style comes with a black steel band.  I don't like black steel bands because the black scrapes off too easily, which makes those watches look really ugly after a while.  But that won't happen with this watch!  Thanks to the polished uncoated stainless steel casing and band, there's nothing that will chip off over time!  In addition, this watch is stylish, easy to read, comfortable, glows in the dark, and has the treasured indiglo light up function that Timex is famous for.  Out of all the watches I've owned, this is definitely my favorite!, I have over twenty watches, from an Omega Seamaster to a fifteen dollar Casio.  This is the finest built looking watch I have ever seen or owned.  I have nothing to say other than it's definitely worth the roughly $400 I paid for it., Really pleased with this watch.  The only thing I'd change would be to add some luminescence to the hands.  However, with the light it's easy to read at night.  (For a quick glance at the time ).<br />It is lighter than the picture so look at some of the reviews on you tube for a better idea of the color. I love the color.<br />It has everything I need in a watch and it's light weight.  It's not too big for a woman.  It's stylish to wear bigger watches., It's ok, just the right size, face is a lot closer to yellow than tan. Looks good, pretty accurate, haven't tested it's water resistance (nor do I plan to), but if that's important to you then look elsewhere, product page states that it's ok with splashes, but not with submersion. This is a decent daily watch if that's what you're looking for., Received this watch very quick! Great brand and quality! (This IS a real Nixon... Unlike the other user said.), I needed a watch for work. It needed to be able to be durable, easy to read, easy to wash and preferably have military time. All thing achieved by this watch. People that complain about the instructions and buttons are probably Morons that don't know their ass from a hole in the ground., If you're not used to a big 50+ mil watch steer clear. It's a big watch but it's oddly comfortable for its size due to the soft rubber band.<br />Seems to run as it should and for the price $61.28 you really can't go wrong. I have been wearing it and for casual situations it is actually growing on me and doesn't appear so Flava-Flave to me anymore., Thank you!, Cute but the crystal lid fell off after a few weeks,, This is a stunningly gorgeous watch. Can wear with jeans or dressier clothes. It just simply goes with everything. I get tons of compliments on it., I've purchased self winders from other vendors here, but this one is ow one of my favorite watches. Keeps good time, actually self winds. Very stylish. Flatly, I love this watch! You CAN NOT BEAT THE VALUE!, High quality watch band.  Time will tell how it holds up.  I expect mo issues though., MK has done it again. This is a very handsome watch. It was a birthday gift for my husband and it definitely makes the man. They spared no expense in design, excellent craftsmanship !!, My first skeleton watch. Pretty cool watch. Very large face. Arrived promptly and in good condition, I've been purchasing Hadley-Roma straps for years. They are reliable, well made moderately priced watchbands. This one is no exception. Coarse grained, genuine leather, not that cheap bonded leather or PU leather. Calfskin wrist lining and superb white stitching. Stainless steel buckle. Save your spring bars, my band did not come with new spring bars. Fits my watch and wrist superbly, perfect, Perfect!, Quality product., Not what was expected, Bought it as a gift and the response was very positive. Very trendy and fashionable. The price is like almost 1/3 of what I saw in stores., I wish I could give this 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Good:  It works great as a watch.  Despite whatever any other complaints I have of it, I've worn it doing tons of different activities and its survived just fine. I've showered with it on accident, done dishes, etc, and it hasn't worn down too bad yet, nor had component failure.  Have had it 2 months and haven't had to correct the time yet.  That's pretty solid for $12 Casio.<br /><br />The bad: The band is super cheap; which was to be expected because, surprise!, so was the watch. In fact, the whole watch looks a little dinky upon close inspection. Looks good from far but far from pretty.<br /><br />Overall; I got what I expected., Nice watch. Was a painful experience adjusting the strap. I suggest going to a jeweler to get that done if you buy one. Or, at least get some tweasers with the watch strap adjustment kit!<br /><br />The watch fits well, the strap--once adjusted--is very secure, with a double fastener. This can be difficult to get off though.<br /><br />The mechanism is keeping good time so far, only had it a week, so difficult to tell just how good it it.<br /><br />The chronograph functions are nice.<br /><br />Not actually got it wet yet, so, cannot confirm the 1,000ft of water--pretty sure the watch would survive and I wouldn't., Beautiful !, excellent, The watch came wrapped very well. Beautiful watch, easy to set & keeps perfect time., Good for the price.  Florescent hands don't glow at all.  Had it one week and am happy., I love it!  I just retired and was looking for something casual. The white goes with anything I wear., Cheap junk, pins break easily, Excellent, This watch is lighter than I expected-- maybe just because the band is so light. It looks great! Can't complain for this price. The people complaining about the sound of the second hand clearly don't have any analog clocks in their house; the tick from my alarm clock is much louder. This watch isn't loud at all., It dies all that I wanted of it., Nice watch. Good color, all the sparkly stones are there. Watch function works. The closure fit slightly crooked. This watch is made for a small wrist. Just right for my galpal, she liked it. Great price for a cool &#34;just because' gift., Fits my Casio watch perfectly!, Works very well with my Asus Zenwatch.  Word of warning:  The clasp system complete separates the two sides; it is NOT the style where the clasp system essentially makes the watch band wider so you can take it on and off.  It's a little more complicated to put on, but it's really not that bad.  The tool that is included is garbage (breaks under the slightest amount of force), but thankfully it's not necessary for anything.  You can pry up the little clamp that keeps the adjustable part in place with a knife (be careful!) or a small screwdriver.  Once it's up, tug on it with some force and it will move.  Use both thumbs to push it all the way back down.<br /><br />Unlike the included tool, the band and clasp feel top notch and extremely sturdy.  The two included pins worked fine on my watch.  If you want a metal band without annoying links that can break or have pins fall out, get this guy.  It's a steal at $11., Love the watch! The watch and band have a mirror polish finish. The clasp is very easy to manipulate to open and close. Face is easy to read, but no lume indicators. I have larger wrists that measure around 8 inches and like to wear my watches a little on the loose/relaxed side. It fit perfect for me right out of the box., This watch is beautiful and versatile. It stands out and gets noticed but not so much that it appears gaudy. This is the first watch that I've owned with the larger case size so I have found that it takes some getting used to. But I bought a black Fossil watch of the same dimensions because I liked this one so much. And the 11 yr. Fossil warranty on the mechanics was a deciding purchase point for me. I'm actually looking at getting a 3rd Fossil watch so I have one for every occasion. If you're thinking about it, GO FOR IT!!, Product is as described. Satisfied customer would order from this provider again., Omg! You get what u pay for ... lol I bought 3 of these in different colors and each watch malfuctioned and broke in less than ah week. I couldn't give it zero stars cuz it sure doesn't deserve one star, I really like this watch. I work for a fire dept and as a paramedic, so it nice to have an analog watch that looks nice and traditional, but still have the functionality of the digital display and 24/hr marks on the face. Also it has an illumination button and date/day on the display. All in a watch that costs 50-60$ not to shabby. I've been wearing timex for years and they hold up great, I'm hoping this one will do the same. I would buy another one of these watches., I'll be honest I have never liked the cheap feel and look of the G shock watches but I was looking for something that combined sport with style in all white color and this one caught my eye. Maybe I'm colorblind but all the pictures I've seen of this watch look WHITE and the main reason I bought this particular watch was because I thought it was white but it is indeed GREY not white. I set the watch up with the provided instructions and I've been wearing it all day and I like it a lot. Even though it's not white the gray colors pretty cool and it's definitely stylish and comfortable. I can't think of any downside to this watch five stars on this end!, Larger than expected., excelente, Just got this watch and it is beautiful.  I have been looking for something like this as a statement watch.  This watch  oozes confidence and polish - pulls together an outfit wonderfully.  I have only had Citizen Eco-Drives and they never disappoint.  I was just ready to update my look and this watch helped me accomplish that., I got broken one. The glass near the butterfly was broken., My brother likes it very much., Perfect!, awesome, Beautiful watch better than I expected, I have had this watch for a year and worn it almost daily, including in the shower. It still works and the strap hasn't broken. A little hard to see the dial in the dark., This came in the mail a lot sooner than i thought it would! i am very pleased with this product!! it is a very simple watch and very easy to use. It also tells you the day and the year and even counts the seconds for you with just a press of a button. It is made very well and is very comfortable. The only thing i don't like about it is that it does not stay on. You have to press the button in order to see the time. I can't wait to wear this to work! Also just another tid bit. if you do purchase this watch make sure to push the little holes out of the band so you can actually wear it. When i first tried to put on the watch it wouldn't hole and i had to firmly press out the holes to make it stay, Otherwise this is a great product. I received this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review., I've gotten a lot of compliments on this watch. It's beautiful and works very well., I really like the style of this watch. You're able to wear it with casual or formal clothes. I personally think the size of the watch is just fine. My old watch was just this size and I personally do not like smaller watches as I am not accustomed to them. As far as the leather band, yes it does get some used to because it is thick. I am also not too keen on the white stitching but that's just my personal taste. I will choose to replace the band when it wears out. Overall it is a stylish watch.<br /><br />The only con I don't like about it is that it chose to highlight the minutes rather than the hourly numbers. Sure you can tell from the position of the hour hand but it does take some getting used to. The minute hand and second hands are also hard to see in darkness. However I'm sure I'll get used to all of this.<br /><br />The biggest strengths of this watch are the styling, eco-drive (no need to replace the battery every year) and the Japanese movement which I hope will last., I had bought a Triumph motorcycles brand watch that looks like a TAG Heuer Monaco. The watch had a nice band but it just didn't go with the watch. The watch has a black face with red markings and the new band really accents the look. The black crocodile skin pattern and red stitching is very pleasing to the eye. The band is a little stiff but it loosens up with wear. Toscana makes a great product I highly recommend it., Bought as a gift, and the recipient was very pleased., The watch is even nicer and more attractive than pictured plus it functions wel. I'm very pleased with my purchase., A gift for a young man.  The picture was somewhat misleading as it appeared that the lid was mirrored. It is not---just clear and see through, I like the watch. I changed the strap. It was not very good. Upgraded to a better one. Make an inexpensive watch better overall., I bought one and the band broke, but I liked it do so much that I bought another one. I hope the band does not break again., PROS:<br />-clean look<br />-slim face/dial<br />-strong leather<br /><br />CONS:<br />-small loops that hold the strap are weak and fall/rip off easily<br />(had to get mine replaced on week 1), I actually really like this watch.  The only issue I'm having is that inside the face gets condensation.  Hoping it won't be on ongoing issue, since I really like it!!, Love the timer. Easy to set. Display isn't as small as some of the reviews say. In a crowded area though, you would have a hard time hearing the timer though. Plus there's no way to change the sizing of the band, at least not to my knowledge. Overall good buy for the cost. The stainless steel has a nice look to it, Thanks a lot!  beautiful!, Great watch.  Handsome and solid, if a little bulky.  I had an earlier version of this watch so when I destroyed it, I came back for another.  Only criticisim i have of this and another Bulova Marine Star model I have is that the crystal has an unbeveled edge that rises about 1/128 of an inch above the bezel and this unprotected sharp glass edge is very easy to chip if you run it into a door frame (as I often do).  Otherwise, I love the Bulova Marine Star line and they are a tremendous value., Quite a nice watch, girl friend likes it a lot, the only problem is that it's not easy to read the time, I guess she needs some time to get used to it., The watch is beautiful and very functional but the leather band could be a notch or two longer., It already broke, Great watch, fits well and the dial is nice and clear, especially with the magnified section over the date making that easy to read. The blue dial rim gives it a professional look, price was excellent., Just like the original that flat wore out after years of service. If you're looking for a stock replacement this is as original as it gets, This s watch is too big for my taste. It is my first Nautica and truly I did not like the quality of it for the price. Is it possible to return it ??, Junk, the watch face cracked in two days, threw it in the garbage., beautiful watch, inside was dirty and is not possible clean, Like all the times watches this watch is also very good. Inexpensive for the quality,looks so classy and beautiful. Very comforatble can wear continously for hours., The face is a little smaller than expected, I do not like this product cause it looks like an old one, the two watch straps worn, cannot as a present., Great classic. Have had it only a week but accurate to the minute according to atomic clock. I used a very small amount of olive oil ( a hint from my friendly cobbler ) to relax the watchband a bit and the color change was minimal. It's always nice to see the second hand purr as opposed to quartz., It looks good, and for the price It's really a good purchase. The pins that came with mine were flimsy and were also different in size. However I didn't care since I'm using my watch's original pins. My order came with a free spring bar as well., strong and durable watches,including band six,ael,tough solar,very good sports watches., Shame on Amazon - I initially could not pair the watch because it was already paired with &#34;Julie's iPhone&#34;.  I had to deleter the previous pairing in order to pair my phone with the watch.  The phone also had various information saved on it from &#34;Julie&#34;.  The watch arrived loose in the box (out of it's holder and retail box).  There was no lens protector (peel off film) that a new watch would have had.  The watch was clearly USED, not new.  Amazon is not advertising this item as used, so BEWARE!  I expected a new product, otherwise I would have ordered it from WalMart.<br />Now, about the watch - The watch works as advertised (other than having to clear someone else's data off it), and I am very happy with it's operation.  It stays paired and gives me all the notifications on my iPhone 6 (IOS 9 Beta).  Nice watch, but thanks to Amazon, I took away 2 stars.  Order this product if you want a &#34;USED&#34; watch!, Ive had this watch for a little over 8 months now and it still looks good. I usually wore it out to Vegas but now just wear it anywhere. The glass is still clear and a few scratches on the band but good. Considering I've hit around a lot. People usually ask me how much it cost and I tell them over 100 lol, Love this item. it's a quick and easy way to class up your living space. If you require or desire a small place to store your keys, loose change, collar stays, cuff links, or any small items you may accumulate in a day's work, this should fit the bill. It's a bit smaller than I imagined, and when buttoned up, it provides around 25 square inches of room for your things (5 inches per side). No complaints, though; it holds everything I need. I trust the Wolf brand, so I expect this to last me a number of years.<br /><br />As some other reviewers have suggested, this could be a great item for travelers. When unbuttoned, it can lay flat in a suitcase or bag. When buttoned up, it can make keeping track of your small items in a hotel a breeze. I may pick up another specifically for this purpose.<br /><br />Solid buy. Would buy again without hesitation., The case is small. And so the watch looks small, too.The watch works well., Listed originally at $120.00, a bit high, a real steal at $35.00 !  The world is rediscovering analog, and its' many advantages over digital.  Please note for you early Xmas shoppers, this watch comes in a really nice gift box, for gift giving., This is a great, durable watch strap. It was difficult for me to find a military-style green strap so I was happy that I came across this one on Amazon. I have a gold-rimmed Bulova dial that I use with this and they compliment each other perfectly. I don't wear a lot a flashy colors so this was my way of adding color to my wardrobe. I would definitely recommend this product., Great watch. I have been wearing this type of watch for the last 30 years. Just purchased my third one over that period of time. I work in a very hazardous environment and this watch takes it all. Like the old saying goes, &#34;It takes a licking and keeps on ticking&#34;., I like the looks of it, which is why I bought it and the functions of it., This watch its a lot better on the picture, i don't know why but i my hand i don't like, Thanks a lot!  beautiful!, I didn't like this watch at all. In fact this is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon. The band looked cheap and not sturdy. I felt the timepiece itself was not substantial or built in a way that I would trust for sturdiness. Completely turned off by the watch in person. Nice packaging though.<br /><br />For the same money I would buy an Invicta (which is exactly what I did), So happy to see this in 16 mm. The 19-20 works well for the men's weekender... The women's weekender needs this size to fit.  Who doesn't need a navy blue one too!, I BOUGHT THE TOOL TO REPLACE THE BATTERIES MYSELF, SO I COULD SAVE THE MONEY. AND TIME NOT GOING TO A STORE. It WORKS SO GOOD!!, I bought this because I soooo love stuffs with heart. It was delivered earlier than it should be. The chain was long, just right for me..The heart shaped clock pendant(locket) is just perfect in size.I like it.However, I gave only 4 stars because the lock was really hard to open. I almost break my nails. You can't open it with just a snap..I hope the lock was easy to open so I could check the time without hassle.<br />I got this discounted in exchange for my honest review., I like it!, looks a little cheap and plastic-ish. But gets the job done (tells time) and is water proof, Cute, Neutral so goes with a lot., I love this watch but the band was a little too stiff for me. I replaced it with a two toned silver band and I can't take my eyes off it.  It runs great and accurately. I'm seriously thinking about ordering a second one. Luv it, Luv It, Luv It.  This watch is a must buy.<br />Update<br />Bought a second one and changed the band to a two toned stainless steel band by Speidel. My first watch still looks a runs great. I have poor eye sight but the chrome hands against the black dial makes it very easy to see. I own a bunch of watches - high end and low end - this watch is my favorite !, Just received the watch today, very nice looking but a bit difficult to set up as least for me. Definitely worth the $29.99 just waiting to see how long it lasts. I will do a follow post in a couple of weeks., JUST LIKE AT THE PICTURE, This watch does deliver on its promise and was very easy to set in all of its modes.  I would recommend this for anyone who wants accuracy without the hassle., Wore this in the pool first day and bezel fogged up.  I like the style of watch and functions so going to risk a replacement and hope it works., Its perfect but i cant really tell the numbers from the lighting because is to white and bright but its nice, heavy, pretty big but i like it... not feminine look at all though, Great watch.  The face is a little bigger than I thought (I have very small wrists) but not too much.  The brushed gold color is gorgeous., I get a lot of compliments when I wear this watch.  The big face and big numbers are easy to see.  The band is a little too big for me, but I do have extremely small wrists (5.5 inches).  Something interesting about this watch is that the back of it is plastic instead of metal., Mooi horloge, goede kwaliteit voor niet te veel geld., Gorgeous watch. I catch myself staring at it all the time. Lots of compliments. I've had it for 2 weeks and it hasn't lost one minute., Band broke in six months. Now it is totally useless. The stitching broke where it was attached to the watch. Save you money., This thing is gorgeous all around. A show stopper. Not for every day use but very special occasions. If you want to &#34;wow&#34; the crowd, this will do. I love it. I would recommend buying from the MK store or authorize dealers like Dillard's or Macy's. It's not a Rolex but still, it's a $550, you better off knowing you getting the real deal. It's a gamble buying online. I heard some people complaining about it being cheap yellow and cheap looking, they most likely got a fake. This watch dreams quality and sophistication. The pictures don't do it justice. I totally recommend it., The band I received looked just like the pictures.  The links slightly oval and very flat.  It appears so far to be very high quality but time will tell. I had no problems putting the slide attachment into the watch.  It clicked right in and has felt very secure so far.  i will say that I probably have an average wrist and did not have to remove any links.  So if you have a larger wrist this will probably not work for you.  I did see the pictures that another purchaser posted in a review of this band and mine does not look like that.  If my opinion changes I will add to the review at a later date., Quality seems to be less than I was expecting.  Very light metal, EXCELLENT :, I really like this watch. The large numbers makes it so quick and easy to see and from someone who is largely blind it's been a huge help. A number of watches are going to this larger style face so it's of modern design. I haven't used the alarm part yet but I'm sure it will be fine. For the money it's a great product., Very good Watch,<br /><br />I recently start to work as a server so i needed a strong watch that resist every kind of hits and was resistant to water, etc. The only thing i dont like too much is when you set the time may move a little. About the rest no complains, good price though., LOVE this watch. I have &#34;dainty&#34; (okay, extremely small) wrists and struggle to find a watch that is not a child's watch, that fits me. The Velcro strap is super easy to get on and I'm able to adjust, unlike traditional bands. It was easy to program after I found the instructions on the company's website. You will need to go to their website as the box does not include instructions, but directs you there instead. Dries very quickly after being wet, which is nice., clip pin fellout in just two days. trashed it., Big watch - need a large wrist to make this watch work for you - pretty heavy as well.  But love the visibility of the dial and overall ruggedness of the watch.  Wished the band was a bit softer - but overall I would buy it again and highly recommend it., Watch so far keeping good time. Very light to wear . A little too light, feel a little cheap. But it's only a $20 watch. Had it only a month, time will tell., Solid feel, solid weight, beautiful crisp color and contrast, great price, and hopefully good for years to come.  Band is large to allow for plenty of custom lengths.  Thank you manufacturer!, beautiful watch goes well with dress and casual look. arrival in two days as promise., I received the wrong band, This watch is Huge for a woman's watch, Huge face. Looks good from far, up close its a little disappointing, Ok, Good Watch... The buttons all all difficult to operate & you have to push them multiple times...<br />You need to read the small operators manual CAREFULLY in order to set the watch up correctly...<br />The World Time does not allow you to keep both times (current time & world time city) on  the display at the same time...<br />I do like it... It's better  than my last watch..., Although I own much more expensive watches by Gucci, Movado, and Citizen, I absolutely love this watch.  It looks, feels, and operates like it costs at least 10 times more than the price!, Only three buttons, making settings difficult.  Average use. Bought April 2014, died August 2015.  Hinge broke, rendering watch unwearable., This is my first automatic and I wanted something that would stand up to the crazy rain storms we had at my summer house. I also wanted something easy to see, as I do have some vision loss. This is definitely it. The Lume on this thing is incredible. Very easy to see for long periods of time. It keeps good time, too. So far it has gained +5 seconds per day. So why four stars? The wrist strap. Let me qualify this by saying that it is a beautiful strap, and if you are an &#34;average&#34; guy, you will have no issues with it. Me? I have very small wrists. So small, in fact, that sometimes a woman's watch would better suit me. Having looked at the photos on Amazon and elsewhere, I misjudged and thought the strap would have enough holes for me. It didn't. We had to punch two extra holes, and now it's a little too tight. It has gotten better, but I do think that once the factory strap goes, I will equip it with a metal one with the proper number of links removed if I can find one. Aside from the strap, this is a definite keeper. :), The face and strap are a bit skinnier/smaller than expected. If you're looking for an elegant and small &#34;women's watch,&#34; this is the watch for you. However - if you are tall (I'm 6') and consequently have big wrists, and/or prefer something with a bit more weight to it, look elsewhere. It's small enough that I can only wear it on the first or second notch, but I love the style so it's grown on me a lot., don't buy bad quality, It works pretty well, but requires a lot of elbow grease. So be prepared to rub for a while., I purchased this watch a little over a month ago and I am definitely glad I did, I like it a lot and get plenty of compliments. Can't beat the price and it keeps good time., This is a beautiful watch -- both the band and the face are exquisitely designed.  As for functionality, it is simple in its telling of time, date and day of the week.  The traditional second hand also serves as a timer in conjunction with the smaller left side timer that keeps track of minutes up to 30.  The time zone indicators can be helpful to indicate the current time of major cities; although, the text is very small and difficult to read if not seen at a good angle.<br /><br />In the hand, the watch feels heavy, and I thought for sure it would weigh down my arm once on my wrist; however, I do not notice anymore weight than with light watches.  The face of this watch is thicker than watches I have previously work.  I am concerned about scrapping it or banging it on walls, doors, etc, because of its width.  After getting the watch band shortened for free at a local jeweler, it fits snugly and nicely on my wrist.  I considered adjusting the length myself, but after watching the jeweler doing it with the unique equipment and skill I believe that was the right decision.  It only took a few minutes to get it just right.<br /><br />I believe this is an appealing watch for its appearance and use.  Its sturdy quality and water resistance also makes it good for outdoor activities.  I have received many compliments on this watch., Great watch so far. I thought the crystal got scratched but it cleaned up nicely. I wish the hands were luminous as I originally thought but no luminescence. The straps don't seem real strong hence the second one. Can't wait to see how well it does at 90 ft. down. All in all it is a very good watch for the price. So far, fully recomended., My son has been wanting a wooden watch and when he seen this on Amazon he had to have it.<br />He was so happy he went ahead and bought this piece. It is so nice and unusual. He loves the large face on it and how it looks and fits on his wrist. It looks great with any style of clothing you wear too., This is a big improvement over the band that comes with the Pebble watch.  It is strong, but soft., It does have a little bit of bling to it w a smaller face.  Great quality and looks classy, For $17, I doubt a better watch exists. I will probably buy one every year or two because it's extremely practical and it's also very comfortable., CRAP!, This is a big bold watch. Very bright and white and that is exactly what I wanted. I have received a number of complements when I wore it as it does make a statement., Broke within the first week of use, not impressed, Price is too high for the product, Unless it was a mistake, the watch I got has ALL markings on the dial in orange. The picture online has the brand name and the rest in of marks in white.<br />All marks being in orange lowers significantly the watch's appeal and appearance. It is not a bad looking piece but in my case too different to keep it., I bought this for my husband for our 5th Anniversary and its amazing and my husband loves it! The only thing is that it took 8 days too ship which sucked but it was well worth the wait!, Very small numbers and date, Love this watch. It looks similar to much higher priced watches (shinola comes to mind), but it does feel a bit cheap when handled, the metal is too light and almost plasticky adn the strap is thin and feels a bit cheap as well, but it all looks great and is comfortable. For the price, you just can't beat this watch. It does not suffer from the loud ticking that has been associated with the standard weekender, it is very quiet., I bought this band because although the pebble is waterproof, the original leather band isn't. I took a chance with only two positive reviews total and a $10 price tag, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br />The band fits the pebble perfectly. It looks and fits fantastic. The buckle that comes with the band is very beefy and has a nice brushed stainless steel finish that matches the watch. Very high quality stuff. The band itself is very substantial, not thin and cheap. One added bonus is that you could replace the very nice buckle with your original pebble buckle and it will fit perfectly and will give it the oem look.<br />I highly recommend this very modestly priced band.<br />Ps, I don't always write reviews. But when I do, it's because I was impressed., Excellent, Returned it. Second hand didn't line up with second tick marks. Decided to get a Mondaine automatic instead and am very happy with it. The dial also looked too large on my wrist., My life loves this watch for everyday use. Very reasonably price. would recommended., VERY nice and expensive &#34;looking&#34;.  This is 2nd one for wife.  The first one is over two years old and running fine.  Haven't lost any of the stones as some reviewers complained.  It looks like a $75 watch, and I think she paid $69.95 for the first one.  Got this one on deal of the day for $30... we've very happy., Nice watch, but it gets 4 stars since &#34;Easy-To-Read&#34; is misleading. If your looking for an easy read watch look into the Timex easy read watches. This watch is not that easy to read in low light or at all angles. I think the solar panel is to fault for this. The solar panel is under the watch face, so if you spend a lot of time outside it's, like I do, always charging.  Like others have said the band is a bit tight. To fix this put the band on something twice the size of your wrist for a couple nights to stretch it a little. My wallet did the trick. The other option is to buy a quality band, but this will run your more then the price of this watch., Love the watch but it came defective out of the box. Only buy from a reputed seller or directly from Nixon's website. Now I have to go through the lonwinded process of getting this thing returned, shipped promptly - product as advertised - thanks!, I hate it.  First of all I waited forever to get it and then they sent blue- the color of my room is red and I ordered red.  Secondly when the hands are on the part of the other lines you can not tell what time it is.  When you can see them they are not lit as in the pix they are very faint.  Finally I just made it an expensive night light for my bathroom.  Worst purchase I've made that cost over a hundred dollars.  I know I could have sent it back but I threw all the paper away before I realized it was such a dud.  Cute idea, horrible product.  L. Marie Rhyne, I've had several Casio watches with good experiences over several years. But this watch, shipped by Amazon February, 2015, has begun randomly &#34;rebooting&#34;, meaning losing its time setting and all other settings (like time zone, etc.).<br /><br />I see Amazon's return period has lapsed, so I contacted Casio tech support. The courteous Casio rep, given my explanation, said &#34;that's easy to fix -- the battery needs to be replaced&#34;. He told me this replacement can't be done just anywhere -- it has to be sent to a Casio repair center at estimated cost of $10-$30. Hmm... for a $24 watch? And I'm not sure whether that estimate included shipping charges. Casio said that a local jewelry repair shop would screw it up and void the warranty. I suspect the cost of battery replacement by Casio would exceed the price of a new watch.<br /><br />If you filter these reviews for 1 star reviews only, you'll see that lots of folks are having the exact same problem with this watch.<br /><br />If the Casio tech is right and it is a battery problem, why is my battery (and many others) failing after only 6 months? Amazon, are you shipping watches that been sitting in the warehouse for a long time, with nearly-dead batteries? If so,you are putting your customers in a bad position, receiving watches that are likely to fail shortly after Amazon's return eligibility period expires, in a way that is not covered by the Casio warranty.<br /><br />All that said, the watch itself seems pretty nice -- except that it has let me down several times, and that it expresses its need for a new battery through random, hard-to-diagnose, failures!, I like this watch, it has all the regular stuff: stopwatch, alarm, light.  This has dual time zone, compass and thermometer.  Now if you want an accurate reading you should remove from your wrist, for the thermometer.  The compass is helpful enough, you get N,S,E,W also get the degrees. The instruction were easy to follow for set up and calibration of the compass., I actually bought this as part of a Marty McFly costume. Solid and easy to use., When received was DOA. Good looking time piece but it had to work for it to be practical. Will follow up when replacement arrives, This watch is clean!!!<br />A must order it has real crystals in it and shines with and without the sun, a real eyecatcher!!, Beautiful!  A gift for my daughter., My partner and I were stressed out that we would have to replace his G-Shock watch, since it was just a band that was busted, before he went back on deployment.  His watch is very expensive. However with the replacement bands the watch works like new, without having to buy an entire new watch!, I really like this watch--I collect watches so it's getting harder and harder to impress me with one, but this is a great one. The way the band attaches to itself beyond the buckle is very handy, diving or not. In fact, while this watch was made for use in water, it's perfectly suited to anytime wear., I have had this watch for 7 years now. I have never had a problem with it. I wear it everyday and i love it so much it is the first watch i had and the best one. It is so durable, after 7 years it has one small scratch on the glass and the small thing on the strap is starting to rip. I hope it last me many more years and if tou are licky enough to find one for sale i highly recommend you buy it., Had this watch for about four months now and am really impressed. I wear this watch 5-6 days a week usually about 10-12 hours a day and it keeps perfect time. I probably wont ever buy another watch that is not powered by automatic movement. It fits comfortably and has a high quality feel. Its been in the water and shower and have never had any issues with water. A couple minor cons to this watch for me are the magnified date and the thickness of the case. I would like the looks of this watch even more if it didn't have the magnification over the date but it does make it easy to read and the case thickness is only a couple mm too large for my taste. Overall a great watch that I love wearing everyday. A smart purchase I would make again., Small on wrist, but purchased it for the old school look. Typical great Casio quality., This watch is beautiful!  Nice heavy weight, decent size without looking masculine. Very classy look for a reasonable price. Note: not all jewelers will be able to adjust the size/remove links, excellent..., Beautiful watch. It did get water in it when I went swimming on vacation, which is why I only gave it 4 stars., Gorgeous watch. I love the blue and stainless steel, classy without being flashy. Perfect size face not too big but not too small, nice weight and clasp seems fine to me., This was probably the best watch I have ever purchased. It is a very nice quality watch, and I recommend it to the fullest extent. It has so many features and options it constantly gets more interesting. The one setback though is the thermometer. It is not entirely accurate because when wearing it, knew body heat affects the reading. So if you want an accurate reading you should probably take the watch off. Other than that it is a very nice watch. I'm very pleased!, Met my need. Happy I own it..., My father thought that it was the best watch he have ever bought. I must agree that it looks really solid for it's price., The watch is very pretty. I have a very small wrist, so the watch's face looks very large on my wrist. At first it felt a little heavy, but I don't wear watches to often., This is an all around inexpensive yet capable, not gawdy, watch that has all,of the features I look for in a watch. It is both analog and digital, waterproof( I regularly dive to 100ft with mine), illuminated, and it has an alarm. At only around $30, there is a huge amount of value in this sharp little watch. I highly recommend it for daily use., Battery went out no one will replace, Pretty, but came with DEAD BATTERY., Purchased for The Wife, who had trouble seeing the numbers (numbers appeared clear, but orange glow from the back lighting did not agree with her - she says it gave her headaches). She passed it along to our son, who was able to use it., Only gave it one star because I coulnt leave a big fat zero., Nice watch, watch bracelet strap seems too large for the watch and was very stiff., Self-winding is not for me...and this watch is a little too large and masculine., I am pleased with my watch.  The price was less than half the jewelry store cost., Extremely gorgeous and runs very precisely, This watch was just what I needed to track time in a dark room without being conspicuous. Good large face and good price. Band runs large. and doesn't have a shiny finish to it. All in all, and for the price, I thought this a satisfactory purchase. The watch came packaged in a small cardboard box without any protection, but arrived unharmed.THEN I wore it to the function it was specifically purchased for. This watch does NOT keep good time. I have now placed two new batteries in the watch, yet, it failed me yesterday at an event--October 17, 2015., I like the watch but after two months the battery died., Wow what a stunner!!!, It's just what I was looking for. It has a basic dial but very nice detail that can only really be seen up close, when you're actually holding it. It's simple, but has a touch of elegance and it looks and feels great., Very nice watch. Be aware that is a chunky watch, and a heavy watch which surprised me, and more so than similar watches. But this is not a worry on my wrist and it has a nice look about it. Keeps excellent time. The date display is large which is one of the reasons I chose this watch. Good quality and feel. Very happy with this purchase and hats off to Amazon for delivery to my door in Perth Western Australia in 6 days!  great stuff!, Great watch for a registered nurse.  Military time.  Easy date display. Second hand for counting heart rates and respiration rates.  Washes easily under the sink while wearing.  Solid!, It is brighter than expected. I was expecting a black mate color instead I got a black shine color, Pros: still the stylish watch out right now<br />  For its features battery last all day so that's a plus.<br />  Supports most major apps<br />  It's different from most watches interface, I had the pebble,time.<br />  Right screen size, doesn't feel too big<br />  Fast, it never lags at anything it does.<br />  Customizable, there are a lot of watch faces and the new interactive faces you can add to make it stand out more, and new always on feature.<br />  $150 is a great price.<br />  Wifi included with new update<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Overall battery isn't impressive compared to other basic watches that does less.<br />  With its slim design it's hard to stand out with watch skins, like slickwraps have a few but the Bezzle is really slim.<br />  For most women this would be too big, Everything was perfect, didn't work, very beautiful and fancier than i expected. very satisfied., Looks nice. Fits watch. Clasp doesn't stay fastened and several times a day I have to stop the watch from falling off. Too bad, I really liked it and planned on buying a black one. I've gone back to my G-Shock., Awesome watch for the price nice big face everyone gkeeps asking about it, Item arrived with crack in glass and no battery. Tells time correctly twice a day. Not worth sending back., Yay, I purchased this unit over 5 months ago.  It has been running everyday on the bedroom dresser ... with the blue LED turned off (it is VERY bright at night).  So far, this has worked perfectly and it is completely silent.  This was definitely a good purchase., When I saw this watch online the design grabbed my attention. When I got the watch and saw it in person I loved it even more. The watch has a very expensive look and feel, its heavy and a great conversation piece. I however had some difficulties figuring out how to secure the watch on my hand as it was the first coming across one such as this. after some time i finally figured it out. The only drawback was that I thought the leather band would have a richer luster to it. But overall this a great watch and i do not have any regrets making the purchase., Awesome watch but not for big wrist, Excellent! Beautiful. Citizen makes high quality well built watches. I own others and they are bullet proof. I torture test them all... Salt water swimming, steam rooms, sauna, hot tubs... No scratches, no missed seconds...they are good. This one especially is nice to look at., I purchased this watch through another source (Touch of Modern).  I have several metal watches, but this is my first Andrew Marc, and my first self-winding automatic.<br /><br />Quality is first rate.  The band is solid and thick.  It feels like my Bulova more than my Seiko.  Visually it's very appealing, and the quality seems excellent.  I've already gotten compliments on it at work.<br /><br />The band is a bit large.  I had to remove 3-4 links to get it to fit my wrist., i like the look but have trouble latching the clasp., I love this watch. The beautiful simplicity, just the right touch of gold contrast & diamond markers. Absolutely chic, understated elegance., Plenty of supplies for future needs  :), for my farmer dad who likes few things of the world:  pens, watches, pocket knives.  this is a very expensive watch that he would never buy himself.  i got it for a great price., People talking about battery life on this smart watch. Well mine has been off the charger for over 24 hours and still have 24% battery life left. It's a great watch., Picture doesn't do it justice !, I have lots of watches, but end up wearing this one the most. I had one like it when I was much younger. I was tickled to find it again, and with the lovely metal band. It's comfy and even dressy, and just plain cool. The BEST thing about it is the countdown timer. VERY helpful tool, and I use it throughout every day. It's faster to use than your phone. It also has date and stopwatch. I've worn it in the pool and friends worry that it gets wet. They think it was expensive. Every woman needs one of these watches ;), Alright, I love this watch.<br /><br />I'm a 33 year old guy. I dress in a casual way, but I try to wear meaningful clothes -- even t-shirts are carefully selected or vintage. If I'm not going to wear a suit and tie all the time, I at least need to rock the casual stuff properly.<br /><br />This watch is absolutely classic. The sandalwood face is large enough to stand out and subtle enough to look smooth. I'm pretty familiar with all different types of wood, having made furniture and musical instruments in the past, and I know how hard it is to get sandalwood to a smooth finish that doesn't expose porous grain. The sandalwood face is grain-filled well and looks perfect.<br /><br />I also like that there are only hour/minute hands, no second hand. Honestly, if I'm going to time something to the second, I'll use the phone in my pocket. A wristwatch just needs to look great and give me an accurate time reading.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the watch didn't come with any paperwork or instructions. Setting the time is easy enough -- you pop the knob out, twist it and push it back in, like so many other watches -- but it's always nice to see a warranty or contact information. I'd take this to a jeweler to have the battery replaced, though it would've been nice to have a piece of paper with contact info, battery info, whether there's any water resistance, etc.<br /><br />The watch itself is great and the R/W/B band is sharp. It'll take a little time to break in, but the watch is very comfortable and my girlfriend thinks it looks fantastic (and she's a tough critic on accessories).<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review, which I've tried to provide here (check my other reviews, they aren't all positive!). I'm very impressed with this Woodies watch and I will absolutely look for more. Kiiiinda got my eye on the ebony watch!, This was my first Nixon watch, and overall it's a decent piece. The quality is decent, although not great for the price. The blue seemed very attractive to me, and it doesn't stick out too much. I do wish the case was larger., You can pick these up for about half of what this company is charging., Cheap quality. Small then appears on picture, This is a really nice boyfriend watch that isn't too bulky. The face of the watch is more on the thin side and sits really well on the wrist. I went to a local jeweler to have them remove two links. I love the simplicity of it. It is a mixture of matte and shiny silver. I get compliments when I wear it, and it pairs nicely with bracelets. This watch is exactly what I was looking for in a boyfriend type piece., Excellent!, I love the owl itself as a decoration but the watch does not work well....it works...then stops...then works again.  If you need it for use as a watch...forget it.  With the wings closed it is a very pretty key ring., nice watch, band a little cheesy but it's to be expected for the price. Overall good purchase, It's very pretty, I get a lot of compliments. It's also comfy and a tiny bit smaller than I thought it would be, but it doesn't mean I don't like it. The only issue with it is IT TICKS LOUD AF. My boyfriend makes me put it in a drawer at night lol. I'm used to it but yeah, it can be a pain., Very bad item , water enter inside watch, This is a good tool to replace the back on watches with smaller faces. The new watches with the larger faces, the biggest piece will not work.I have a few watches that this will not work on. Maybe I have to buy bigger press pieces to go with this set but haven't look., Purchased this item and received a cheap necklace instead... Not happy., It's awesome 😍😍, velcro doesnt last long..., I like it, Nice case to keep watches organized. It's a pretty sturdy construction. My only gripe with it is the latch mechanism. The release button on the latch feels a little sticky sometimes when I open up the case. The lock on the latch is very basic, you could manipulate it with a paper clip or similar., light sucks. and if you barely touch the dial on the side it will change your stuff, there isn't a lock, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0096LP1C6?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0, MY son like, Thanks a lot!  beautiful watch!, Excellent watch, big digits, it maybe look complicated but once you read the instructions you’ll find it very easy to be operated. Decent size, light weight., It was a hit!!gabe as a birthday gift to daughter,she wears it most days, Very beatiful watch,it is suitable for those who have small wristhand., The watch arrives in good shape. Nice leather bracelet. Fashionable. I get compliments each time I wear it. Definitely a must-have!!, stopped working, Great-looking lots however it was shipped with a dead battery, Nice watch. The only thing I don't like is the little bands that hold down the main band are a bit difficult to use., Great watch pretty easy to use if you read instructions comfortable tom wear looks like it will stand a knock, Igot this as a gift and it is even better in real life. Good quality also, great watch,easy to see numbers on black background and that was the main reason to buy, I started to use only gold color watch. I like it. It looks very stylish like expensive watchers. Nobody can say how inexpensive they are.<br />I have to resize the braslet - did not do it yet., This watch is bought for my sister. The color is stunning!!!She's super satisfied with it, Cute but not very comfortable, Way too big for a woman's watch... I would have returned it but I will try to trade it for a lady lamb (sheep) once I am back in Mexico..., Lg watch urbane and I wish I could upload a photo. Sweeeeeeeet band., HAD TO RETURN THE WATCH,DUE TO THE LINK ON THE BAND FELL OFF., Fantastic watch.  You can see a full review on YouTube if you check out the mainspringreviews channel., Edges easily get dirty., excellent, Very nice and rugged watch for the price.  I get lots of comments and inquiries about my watch.  I have not really gotten it too wet or dirty so I don't really know how it will hold up on that end, but I would definitely recommend this watch.  Great quality for a small price., I bought one of these bad boys and modified into a belt! Now everyone can just look at my crotch to see what time it is., the item not like image. every, Nice watch but if you don't wear it one day then the auto wind is not good enough to keep it running and you have to reset the time., I was a little disappointed...it arrived with noticeable scratch on the face. Other than than that, arrived on time & it works fine., Delivery OK and Excellent Product. Thank you., Good everyday watch.  Simple and easy to read. I like that I don't have to drag my cell phone out of my purse to check the time!, We bought two of these watches for our identical twin girls.  We bought them for the vibrating quality (we wanted a gentle way to wake our children). We also needed a watch that was small enough for their wrist and this watch seemed to fit the bill.  We bought one watch for one of the girls, she loved it so we bought a second one for the other about a month later.  The first watch worked for a about two months  and the second watch broke within a few weeks.  The first watch worked until one day it just continued to vibrate non-stop and light all the functions at once on the screen--the buttons were unresponsive. The second watch worked for about a week or so, but  the watch didn't seem to alarm at the times programmed. It was always off by some amount--10 minutes, 20 minutes, etc...we assumed it was our daughter setting it wrong, or perhaps accidentally resetting it by pressing buttons while sleeping...however, it never worked properly (even when we set it for her) and eventually the buttons also became unresponsive like the other one.  I contacted the manufacturer after 4 months and the rep said, &#34;Well, did you change the battery?  Most likely in both cases it  is because the battery is not powerful enough.  The watch will do respond oddly when the battery needs to be changed.&#34;  However, that doesn't really make sense since for the one watch with the battery in it still vibrates with full force.  She suggested I send it back to her at our expense and they would either replace the battery at no charge or fix it and send it back at to us at no charge.  Oh, and she also mentioned that the batteries only last about 2 months in this watch since the vibration uses a lot of battery power.  So be prepared to spend money on extra batteries.  I also called Amazon and they said that my 30 days had expired, but they would allow me to return them anyway--with a restocking fee of 20% (which was about $15).  Thanks for good customer service Amazon!  &#60;smile&#62;  I also called the Amazon provided watch warranty people and they sent us UPS mailing labels. We were told to return each of them in separate boxes with the labels provided. It would take 5-8 weeks to get the watches either repaired or replaced.  They would update us via email during the process.  We opted to send for &#34;repair&#34; through the Amazon Watch Warranty people-- not sure if that was the right decision or not. Will try to update after repair. It comes with a 2 year warranty via Amazon--so we'll see how it goes.  Update: Sept 16 2015  Was told by repair service that the part needed is no longer made.  So they opted instead to refund my full purchase price via an Amazon gift card. I was told the same thing for BOTH watches.   This ended up being the best option. We got our full money back.  We are going to buy the our children a LIGHT based alarm clock instead., It works, but its not a true NATO watch. No third ring and the band is super stiff. If you are looking for a good NATO watch go for somehting else.<br /><br />Like I said. This work fine, but it is stiff and needs to break in over a week.<br /><br />Fits my OG Pebble nicely., I wear this watch every day. I thought I would buy it to wear every now and again but I love it so much I never take it off! It is comfortable and light. I mat buy another one just in case I ever misplace or lose this one!, The look is ok, Gold on gold face makes it hard to read. The watch slips on my wrist and ends up on the palm side of my arm. Sorry I bought it, Little small and didn't cover my tattoo very well (which is why I wanted it) but it looks really cute., I love this watch! Backlight is a very unique aqua/blueish color (looks much better in person than photo).  Very well made, much more solid than my Casio which cost more.  Purchased from Fly88, and when there was a minor issue they sent an immediate replacement with no hassle., it was everything I expected it to be., It works. But for today's technology, the watch is a little overpriced. Those functions the watch offers are available for over 20 years. Com'n, Casio. Are you selling this like an antique?, Had this wathc for 4months now and I love it... I got so many compliments about the watch saying its really nice and good looking....<br />The quality is really good for it's price... It doesn't feel cheap...It was a bit heavy which is I like the most...<br />Will buy another Elina Baroka's watch..., Terrible quality watches. Not even worth my comment, Great watch for a low price. My 9 year old is very excited with her new watch, it looks pretty and durable., The watch is beautiful and arrived two days earlier than expected.  The only negative is the fact that it is a grey market new watch and not covered by the regular Tissot warranty, but that was disclosed by the seller and shouldn't be a big deal for a watch of this caliber., For that much money it scratches very easy seems cheap but wasn't the red one is 25 bucks cheaper and it's the same jus doesn't say windy city oh well if price was 20 or under 5 star, I love it! I'm a teacher and my students think it's pretty cool. I think the rhinestones make it look cheap--I would have preferred one without the rhinestones. But hey, it's just for fun, and it *WAS* cheap, so it's all good., Nice watch, did not like the stiff bracelet. It didn't feel right on my wrist. Had to send back., I have had the watch now for only a week but so far I'm very satisfied.The only problem I have is that the watch came without an instruction manual and directs you  to the website to download a  manual But when I have gone to do so the manual does not download so I've had to figure it out by trial  and error and have had no luck  figuring out the compass. This was  the primary reason for buying this  model so this is a problem.This watch replaces a Precision 2 0 which I liked very much so I'm hoping to be able to learn how to use the compass or if not I'd be happier with the Precion 2.0. I'll update upon learning how to use the other features, Very nice looking watch at the right price. I am very satisfied with it, so much so that I got one in black and one in blue. Simply awesome., This is exactly the type of watch I've been after.  Aesthetically pleasing, durable and immediately useful.  All watch lovers should have a G Shock in their collection., A very nice everyday watch. Easy to read dial, high quality. If you're looking for a rugged, attractive watch at a very good price, this is for you., 2.5 years later. Still happy with it. I’m hard on it so due to my job (plumber). Going to need to replace the band at some point but they are cheap for this model. It seems like the hands always block the the date which is really annoying. I’ve purchased a second G-Shock to wear on weekends. In summary, I’m happy with this purchase and I would buy it again., Three 1/2 weeks into wearing it everyday, the leather started to wear off. But I didn't mind b/c it added that worn out feel to it, which I liked. My problem was the second hand fall off and the watch no longer function properly. I got a lot of compliments and I did like the style. The middle beaded bans did not stay in place. Not sure if that was intentional with the style but it was annoying. I have a small wrist and it fitted okay. I would have liked it better if the strap holder was adjustable so when I set the hole to the last setting (yes, that's how small my wrist is) the end part was not dangling. If the second hand didn't fall off in less than a month, I would have given it a 4 stars. Sorry, Time100, I had to return the watch., I loved this watch until today when I noticed the second hand has fallen off. I'm so disappointed and now trying to figure out how to have it repaired or replaced by momentum., Just what I need, I have had this watch for over a year an the problems I met were. Friction tab on bracelet clasp broke, it needs regulation -30s/day, ratchet wheel is for a change for broken teeth, screw down tube or crown need replacement. Other that that, cute watch and good presence, but add some more money to the asking price, The watch turned to a terrible color, I got this watch a couple of yrs back and I've loved it since then. I really like the combination of the dial's face and it's outer border. The inner dial looks like a muted/ slightly textured silver color and the overall area and numbers are a good size and easy to read. The dial's border is beautiful. It's a mirror border and it appears to be really unique.The stones however, don't really shine as much.<br /><br />It worked pretty well for 2 yrs and recently stopped working... perhaps needs a batter change. Overall, I really like this watch. I didn't have any issues with the strap but then again, I have a relatively smaller wrist and hence strap didn't require expanding on the wrist., I wear this pretty much all day long...and this is the only watch I wear. Although I have fancier ones, this is so comfortable and convenient. The best thing I like about the Timex is that the glass window is recessed and so doesn't get scratched. For that alone, I'll keep buying these again and again.The light button is not at a convenient point.... would have preferred a swap with the start/split button. Waiting for a deal., It is wonderful!, I have been on a Quest for a Quality Diver watch under $250. I have ordered and returned 5 watches. Brands like Jiusko, Swiss Eagle, Swiss Legend, and Sturhling. All of those are good brands but non was exactly what I was looking for until I got this Invicta. Some where defective and others felt like a lesser quality. The Sapphire glass on the Jiusko was paper thin. The crown fell off the Sturhling and the Swiss Eagle decorative trim came loose under the crystal. I knew when I held this watch that it was quality. The watch looks better in person because the picture doesn't even do the carbon fiber justice. The stainless steel band is a high quality. It is a great watch for smaller wrist like mine. You can also micro adjust the band with the locking mechanism. It has 5 different settings.  The automatic sweeping second hand is my favorite feature. The colors are vibrant but not gody. The screw down crown and uni bezel works perfect. It also has a partial glass exhibition screw down back. The two tone stainless steel is also very attractive and expensive looking. The watch would be perfect if it had three things. Sapphire Crystal. I would gladly pay over $200. A thinner case..it's a touch big. And a flat glass surface. The crystal has a manifyer for the date and looks like it is glued instead of a seamless crystal. I am comparing it to a Rolex or Omega and clearly this is not. This is my first Invicta and won't be my last. Good Job guys for making a quality product at a reasonable price!  Update: after a few days the watch is running 15 mins fast. I am going to keep an eye on it. I might return it if it doesn't keep good time. After all what's the point of a nice watch if you can't count on it to tell you the accurate time!, I love this watch! It's been getting majority of my wrist time since I got it. The lume on the watch is amazing. I work in a fairly well lit office in a warehouse, which is decently lit. When I leave my office and step into the warehouse, I see my watch glowing. It's even more noticeable when the watch gets direct sunlight. The face is easy to read and the band is decent. The clasp feels a bit cheap, but definitely not a deal breaker. I have larger wrists that measures around 8 inches. The watch fit right out of the box with out any adjustments., Construction looks to be of high quality. Pillows for the winder are to small to effectively and securely hold my watches in place while in motion. Since there are three static pillows, Some variability in sizing would have been helpful.  Update; 3 months in the motor squeaks terribly. Sent a note to the vendor shining image. No response! Contact Amazon, they are thankfully standing behind it., This clock does not work.<br />i want to replace it<br />needles do not work, Lovely watch but two rhinestones have fallen out. I have probably worn it 10-12 times. Won't wear any more and probably to late to return., I love it! It is very cute and band is good quality. The face is big, but I knew that based on the pictures when I ordered. It is easy to read and even fits my very small wrist. I have received several compliments on it. My only disappointment is that I paid $34 and it is now $22..., Very good and easy to use and fast shipping, This is just a good looking watch, I purchased it from Amazon because they had the best price, and I wanted a solar watch., The watch arrived on time in new condition. At first I was impressed with the watch (but not the band though - more on that below). The watch has some impressive features such as the excellent nighttime luminescence (almost as good as the Luminox watch I used to own). The second hand moves in a continuous sweep motion and the hour and minute hands line up with the numbers perfectly. The band was too short to wear comfortably on my wrist (which is an average size for a 6-foot tall man) but other than being too short for me the band appears to be made from very high quality leather.  Having said all that, this mechanical watch is supposed to stay &#34;charged&#34; for 42 hours when not being worn and mine never made it longer than 16 to 18 hours without stopping. It also failed miserably to accurately keep time and compared to the USNO atomic clock signal it gained more than 30 seconds per day (difficult to say precisely how much though because it never actually made it an entire day without stopping). After Hamilton confirmed that they only directly provide warranty support if the watch is purchased through one of their authorized dealers I chose to return this defective watch for a refund.  Lastly, but this is a minor point since decent watch bands can be obtained elsewhere at a reasonable price, the color of the band on my watch was a lighter shade than what is shown in the product picture and the color didn't seem to match the black color watch face very well. I did not like the band., The 6900 is really all about style, so I think this colorway exemplifies the streetwear rep this model has. I love how the design permeates through the layers of the watch, even to the LCD. Matte finish is silky smooth, unique., The watch looks really good, however it is very dim. It's really hard to see the time, and I cannot change the time. It comes with a manual, that isn't even for this watch..I'm starting to think I bought a fake one. I'm not happy with my purchase.  :(, Update on 10/6  Over a month passed, since my purchase. The watch still runs reliable without an issue. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Update on 9/13  After returning my first purchase, I was not able to find another watch that looks as good under $500. So, I decided to give it 2nd try, thinking that I could return it if it did not work out. It turned out to be a good decision and, after 11 days, the watch is running strong.  Now, my takes on this watch.  First, the look is great, which is the main reason that I came back. It mimics Rolex Datejust design, a very classic look. I love the bezel and the jubilee bracelet, which make the watch really stand out. The black dial and silver hands & bezel are very classy combination and bring up contrast. The markers look very sharp, particularly under good lighting, even though I am not sure of the their materials. And, for $150, it comes with a Sapphire crystal.  Secondly, the movement has been running strong so far. Like the last one, it runs averagely 8 seconds faster per day, in the past 11 days. I am very pleased with that.  The only thing that I'd recommend improvement is the bracelet. It is not bad at all, just does not look as good as the watch case.  Given all these facts and its amazing price, I give this watch a 5 star review. It beats a lot watches under $500.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The watch ran +8 seconds per day for the first 3 days. Then on the 4th day, it stopped, even if I hand-winded it. It was a very good-looking watch and I liked it very much, but I had to return it. Given the failure, I did not even bother to exchange.  I left 2 stars, one for the look of the watch and the other for hope that mine was just an outlier.  BTW, the return service of Amazon is excellent. Truely hassle free., Excellent, The longer I have this watch, the more I like it.  It seems to be just as accurate as my quartz watches, and the rotor is completely silent (unlike some automatics).  The watch is very comfortable on the wrist.  Beautiful quality!  You get a lot for money: Manual winding as well as automatic winding is a huge bonus as you don't have to use a watch winder to keep it wound.  You also get hacking, sapphire crystal, date complication, solid links on the band. Perfect!  My only complaint against the watch is that the box that it comes in is very cheap looking, but I really don't care about the box.  Seiko obviously put the money in the watch, not the presentation, and that's fine with me., This watch is very classical looking and suitable for any occasions., My hubby likes it, but the metal back caused his wrist to break out in a rash but he will give it another try and if that happens again I will update this post., High quality product., This watch is pretty big, but I after awhile I got use to it and so far people has been complimenting me on it. Overall it's a nice watch., Had the watch for 1 week and the band broke, My daughter wore her watch to school twice and the minute numbers are already coming off. Very disappointed with this watch. I passed up many other watches because they did not have the minute numbers. Had I known this would have happened I definitely would not have bought this watch., Definitely a great purchase. It is so helpful having a watch that has basically the perfect time. The quiet beep every hour really helps staying focused if you are working or studying. The best part of the watch though has to be the coloring, I love how it subtly changes colors depending on the lighting., I have an older Casio model SGW-100B that came with the nylon band. I use this watch for backpacking and other extended outdoor activities and the nylon band gets really funky so I wanted a rubber one. I have searched far and wide until I found this one. It doesn't fit perfectly but with some effort I was able to force the pins on and it's great now. For some reason Casio made this band different from almost every other watch there is as far as how the band attaches so you can't just buy any aftermarket one for it., Smaller than I believed it would be, but works properly., This watch is for the bold.  It will take any business casual outfit to the next level; however, it can be worn well with anything.  The watch is big and heavy but not obnoxiously so.  I work out as much as possible so I have the physique to match the watch 5%.  I have promoted Invicta watches to my peers at work so we can all step up our watch game., It's okay with the price., It is not water-resistant despite what the packaging says. I had to have it replaced because i went swimming with it, and the second they sent still collects water inside it. Regardless, the watch is beautiful and very elegant., Excellent quality and size! Fitted perfectly my, Perfect watch for a nurse., Check the size of the product. This is pretty small. If you want small, you will like it. Good construction., I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  The band doesn't wrap correctly and the diamonds are only decals that are glued to the strap.  Very cheaply made., The strap on this broke after a week! The mild bending of putting on and taking off the watch caused it to break after literally less than 7 days, ridiculous! Otherwise the watch seems fine and looks good. Now I need to see if I can find a replacement strap that won't break so frickin quickly..., Nice watch.  Suggest changing the stock rubber watchband with something better. Waterproof leather or even a NATO looks a bit more distinguished and gives the watch more character., It is an elegant watch.  For my small wrist it is a little heavy for every day use.  But it is great for special occasions., As advertised. Works perfectly and doesn't make any noise., It's a beautiful watch. It's just that it runs small for a medium to large wrist, and the catch won't close., excellent, The watch band was the wright band after I order the wrong one the first time but had no problem exchanging it Thank You Amazon, Awesome watch. I love it. People ask me where and when did I get it. I tell them Riga, Latvia. Fast and well worth the money. Ordering more of this brand soon. Seller rocks., Blue face on dark metal is a great look. Have worn it for several years as my everyday watch, to include outdoor activities and office work. Takes a beating, but has some character to it., Unfortunately the website will not update the watch so we are returning it - can't even get the first football season schedule., I have had this watch for several years now. I am a very active grown women. This watch is perfect for a small wrist-ed (about 6&#34;) women. I have only changed the battery once. I have swum in the Gulf of Mexico, did 30ft+ drops into the bayou with it, gardening, hiking, camping, etc. It's very tough, and the band has held up wonderfully, only starting to show its age this last year. Recently it has begun losing minutes every night. After searching the stores and online for a replacement watch I was sooo happy to be able to find the same watch on Amazon. It's definitely not just for kids!, One of the best prices for the rangeman, and I am a fan of negative displays. Very fast module, accurate., Definitely what I expected.  Authentic Nixon watch.<br />Will soon buy another color from them., Its does not look like the pics at all, its not even working,looking cheap and rust, I am returning it immediately., Looks quite nice but doesn't even stay wound over night. Too much hassle to set the time every single day. I also suspect the leather band won't last  all that long. So, I returned it.<br /><br />I also own the Armitron Men's 20/4768BISV Stainless Steel Automatic Watch and like it a whole lot more. It stays wound for a whole weekend and has a durable metal watch band. I've been using it for 10 months and it's my go to watch now. Only complaint is that there is not enough color contrast between the watch hands and the background gears. But, not a huge issue for me., The band is awesome and great! I love it. I just wish there were more notches because I have a tiny wrist and the extra notch would make it fit better. But other than that, it's a good band, This is a great genuine leather replacement watchband. I needed a 27mm but this 26mm was just fine. The hasp is a matte black. Good quality and price ($25)., I would have given it 5 stars but the band is too small. I have average sized wrists (8&#34;) and I can barely use the last hole in the band. I had to buy a longer band. The watch is great., Me gusta., My teenage daughter loves the color of this watch. It's such a beautiful blue-ish green color. They call it green, but it's more of a sea-foam green. The band is comfortable to wear and uses a buckle closure so it fits just about any write size. It has stopwatch features and an indeglo light for being able to view the time in the dark. And we've found it most certainly is waterproof, as it's been worn accidentally when taking a shower. But the color, that's makes it so nice. The sea-foam color is beautiful!, Very attractive and made a nice gift.<br /><br />Very affordable, but kind of inexpensive in a &#34;don't expect this to work really well&#34; kind of way.<br /><br />Would probably decide to spend a bit more for a higher quality device next time., defective, This is my third watch of this brand. Such a good quality and design, I always ask myself how they can be that cheep. Shipment was fast and item was safely packed., Great sturdy watch. This one is for sure for the man who doesn't mind some weight on his wrist., beautiful watch.  bought as a gift and he wears it every day.  he receives daily compliments.  perfect size on wrist, no water resistant very unhappy with this watch it was a gift for my mother in her bday! :/, junky broke very soon pretty though, I love it! As a Gshock fan I just wanted a really cool black one... This one is perfect. As for visibility, stop trying to read your watch in the dark! Haha. Great watch! Gshock is the best, I like the simplicity, but the sharp look of this watch. It arrived exactly as pictured: brown band, white face, rose gold. My only disappointment is the quality of the band. It is nowhere near as thick as the black band that's on my other Bulova watch., Cute watch which comes w/extra battery.  Just a fun watch., Stopped working after three days.. The knob on the right stopped turning so I couldn't reset the time. Top and bottom knobs do nothing. Looks good and feels nice but spend your $15 on something else., This is a beautiful watch. I wanted a watch with large case and I had three links removed from the bracelet.  Its very fashionable !, I got this watch for one purpose, and that was for counting down to the starting signal of sailboat races where timing is crucial. It's great for that. The countdown time can be set in minutes, e.g. 4 minutes, and then when you see/hear the warning signal you start it. But wait, there's more. If you're slow starting it, you still go ahead and start it and when you see the preparatory signal you hit a button to calibrate it (i.e. the time will drop down to the nearest minute, so e.g. if your watch says 3:10 on it because you were 10 seconds late starting it it becomes 3:00 after pressing the button). But there's even one more great feature, the watch will beep at every minute mark counting down, and then under a minute to go every 10 seconds, and at 10 seconds to go every second. In summary, the watch is great for allowing you to focus on sailing and getting a good start while keeping you aware of the time to the start. Now would I get this watch to wear out on the town? No, but it's a sports watch, that's not it's purpose. It's not exactly bad looking though, for a sports watch. I can't comment on the countdown if you're setting it above 10 minutes, I think you can only set it in 5 minute intervals then and I'm not sure how often it beeps., Honestly it's super cute but the strings for adjustments are too long, it was delivered and didn't work, and it smelled like cat pee...ew., Unfortunately, the watch is too big.  The picture made the size of the watch look similar to other watches.  I had previously purchased an XOXO watch with a leather (buckle up) band.  I am 72 years old and short (5'1&#34;).  I am contemplating returning the watch and getting a similar watch of an appropriate size.  If I decide to keep it, I will have to remove a link and the instructions were not that clear.  It appears as if I have to buy a piece to take the link off or perhaps just use a very small screwdriver., Beautiful watch, seems to be pretty sturdy and smooth in its operations., Awsome, Much larger then it appeared to be on line., Great looking watch!  I have a rather large wrist and was pleasantly surprised to find the band long enough, which is not always the case.  Some of the operation instructions are a bit difficult - like how to change the date only.  But love the orange leather band and black face - very easy to read.  Lots of compliments already on the look of the watch.  I highly recommend it., Everything perfect..., Awesome watch.  Very fast service, For the price, I can't complain.  The watch does look and feel inexpensive.  My biggest concern is that the stem does not screw in.  The instructions are for several models, some that screw in and some that don't.  I'm concerned that the watch may leak while diving but so far so good after about 3 dives.  (The manufacturer cautions that the dive is not designed for diving, but why rate it at great depth if not for diving?), This is a great product. The diameter of the watch is a bit on the small side. I would buy more if it came in different color bands., This watch has a very cheap band, veramente fantastico .grazie, Amazing!! The pictures don't do it justice., The lady likes it, and really that is all that matters.., Excellent product. Cute design. Classy look, It's been several months since I've purchased this and it's still in quality condition. It's very flat, which is excellent because it's subtle and not bulky-looking. I have gotten lots of compliments, more than any other watch I've owned. The subtle details of this watch draws people in closer to examine the aesthetic quality., Bought it to overlap a larger basketball pendant. Although small, which I wanted, it is clearly visible as a medic alert. My only issue is that it has a tendency to flip over the other pendant therefore not visible. Plan to sauter them together., Thin and feels a little cheap., Love it! It goes with everything and is amazing quality to that price!, Battery ran out very fast, but it was so cheap it was ok, The watch didn't indicate of the manufacturing location. After one month of usage, moisture was seen under the glass screen. This watch is like a fake to lure people from buying with a high price. What's the point of 75% to 80%+ discount with the final price is still more than 100$. This is a fraud and I strongly recommend NOT TO BUY this s***., Absolutely love this watch. Stylish, fitting for casual and better.  Excellent quality, keeps good time. Very pretty, and just the right size dial for my wrist.  Easy to read., Everything you need at a great price.  I have already changed batteries and bands., Long proven design, what else is there to say?, This Band is simply amazing it is build with premium material and it works with the 1st pebble but make sure to get it shortend<br />This is the way to go, Used this to fit my Moto360 android watch and it fits perfectly. My only problem is getting the links out adjust the band to fit my wrist and it took some getting use to because the band would pull the hairs on my arm but the band is off good quality and worth every penny, as a matter of fact I did not receive the correct product.  the product i received only had the spring bar remover on it and not the link pin remover.  had to struggle using a paper clip to remove the link pins.  too much trouble to return a $5.50 item to mainland China., outstanding, Too big, I'll need to get at least 4 if not 5 links removed, It makes the most annoying clicking sound when it's winding. I can't sleep with it. I barely stand listening to it, even when I'm not trying to fall asleep., Awesome colors!! I really like it! Nice watch for a cheap price! Thanks. I paid a little more to buy from a seller that is actually located in the USA, so I received it quick. I definitely recommend this seller & the watch., After a day of use, I wouldn't recommend this watch. The bracelet links have a sharpish edge to them, and is not comfortable for long wear times. The chronometer is also pretty s***. When i reset mine, it overshoots the \\\\\"zero\\\\\", so it ends up behind where it's supposed to be. The bracelet is also not securely attached to the watch, mine is already bending after a day of use.    Aside from that, it looks nice for the price, but he above consideration make it not worth the meager price, and I just wish I had found this watch face from another manufacturer. Don't think I'll ever get another Megir or tell anybody I know anything good about them., Broke within 2 days., For the price it's ok. Cheaply made, Two thumbs up, Beutiful watch, perfect gift!, i received correct watch and was credited for shipping paid plus additional amount.  Thank you., I was pleasantly surprised when my watch showed up.  I was looking for a digital that I could read at night. This is the one.  Watch is not small and even though I have a larger wrist, I had to adjust the band to its smallest setting.  GREAT watch for the price!, I would've preferred that the hands were more luminescent.......it has a &#34;backlight&#34; but you have to depress the stem to activate it.  Other than that, its well worth the price., [[ASIN:B00F5QYLRC La Mer Collections Women's LMCLIFTON003 Stainless Steel Watch with Wraparound Brown Leather Band and Chains]] this is way better than, even though the La Mer is double the price. La Mer watch broke in just a couple of weeks and is worthless., Somewhat disappointed in accuracy of this self-winding watch, I was able to open all the watch backs I have tried so far. Saves me tons of money replacing watch batteries for my whole family. Highly recommended., This polish works wonderfully!  I've polished 1960s era plastic or acrylic crystals as well as Swatch Sistem51 watch crystals and it brought the crystals back to brand new clarity.<br />Don't be swayed by negative reviews.  The nay sayers are most likely using it on mineral glass crystals.  This is called Polywatch for a reason—&#34;poly&#34; for plastic or acrylic—not to be used on glass.  Also, a very little goes a long way; so the small tube really is much more than some reviewers would have you believe., The watch looks true to advertisement however what is not known is the 2 silver connectors on the side of the band overlap the watch so you cant see the time/face of the watch without moving the band over.  Maybe if the band was cut a little shorter then this problem would not exist.  Overall though a great product. Also delivery is a little slow since its not USA shipped but worth the wait., I was very excited to get this watch, it finally came in, one thing that i did like was what looked like quality (it is a good looking watch), it looked like it was a very good quality watch, untill metal was able to scratch the sapphire face, for me this dissapointed me very much, one because that is the whole reason i bought this was because i work in an industry where i have to be well dresses although i still do rugged work, this is why i needed a durable watch, metal should not be able to scratch (supposebly) what is supposed to be sapphire this is why i gave it a 1 star rating this is not a sapphire watch face i beleive it is more likely quartz which can easily scratch on metal., It arrived early and it was exactly what it said ., This is my 4th Invicta watch that I have gotten my husband as a gift. He loves Invicta watches, so every once in a blue moon I'll surprise him with a different watch. This one is very simple and classy. Looks even better in person. Beautiful. He is going to love it! Very Happy. If you have very big wrist, you might have to get your own wrist bands for the watch. Other than that it is beautiful and worth the price., One of the reviews that I read cast doubt on the value assessed by Amazon for this watch, but regardless, this is a very nice watch, substantial, attractive and I'm very pleased with it.  I do agree with some of the reviewers that the bands can be a bit difficult to change - I struggled for a bit with one band, didn't succeed in getting it completely inserted because the leather band is just a bit too wide, so am hoping it will slip in with time.  You know that the band mechanism is in place (if you have eyesight issues, the change process could be an issue) when you hear a click.  Which is a good thing because it's not easy aligning the stem with the tiny hole.....The watch is heavy and does roll on my wrist, but I prefer a more substantial watch to something that wont stand up to daily activities including yard work.  I'm not normally someone who would be bothered with changing watchband colors, but these bands are nice colors and the pink - a color which normally gives me hives - is a very nice shade.  Nice watch., small!, Order this watch as a birthday gift, it don't work I am sending it back and requesting a refund., Always come back to a Timex Ironman watch.  It really is a great great watch for me as a runner.  if I want to time laps, I can.  If I want to set timers for intervals, I can do that as well.  I've owned a Timex Ironman watch for almost 2 decades.  I've tried others, but always always come back to this watch. LOVE IT!, I went with a Casio solar watch instead, for $25 because of a lightning deal.  Actually I bought two watches, one red, one black., This watch is amazing. I love traveling and this watch portrays that pretty well. Shipped in a timely fashion, arrived in a Michael kors package, and the quality of the watch is great. I did have to get a few links taken out, but with any watch you do. I definitely recommend this watch., My daughter likes it. The watch looks nice. But the package is too simple., Too big!!'<br />Sticks. Out on wrist like a big case and too heavy yo wear for more than few hours., Excellent as a watct.<br />But not good enough as a bracelet.<br />I change to Leather strap, It is an inexpensive, has nice big display, and useful basic functions.  I wish the watch had a glass lens \\crystal instead of plastic., So this is not just a regular review, I have always loved the invicta company and I ordered this watch thinking I would get an inviota quality watch, but as soon as it was opened I was in awe. This watch is very beautiful but, the third day I wore this watch condensation was already built up within the crystal. I have never taken this watch in water so I assume it happened when I washed my hands, but for a divers watch this was garbage. I highly recommend to buy a different watch., Basic functions, like changing the time, are not intuitive; I was hoping that having fewer buttons would make it easier to operate. But no.<br />And due to the large &#34;Light&#34; button, I assumed, incorrectly, that it had a built-in small flashlight (like an older Casio wristwatch that I have). No again.<br />The Light button only provides a backlight for the display. The Light button failed after a day. But the watch looks good!, Perfect to remind my offspring to take her meds., The Orbita Sparta Bold is well constructed and being battery operated, you can store your watch away in a cabinet or drawer if you don't want it out. I'm sorry I didn't order the delux version which comes in a custom wooden case. I found the sound of the winder while relatively quiet, was keeping me up at night. I had wanted to keep the winder on a shelf on my nightstand but moved it into my walk in closet. Perhaps the wooden case would have muffled the sound.<br /><br />I'm able to keep my Rolex running using the extended 12 minute cycle which increases battery life. All said, I'm happy with my purchase., It does not fit the watch., If your intention is to look like a goon with no style you must own this watch. All others need not bother., Perfect for my needs.  seems durable.  I use it during my football practices.  Stopwatch feature is best, This watch is very VERY pretty! Even though it's a woman s watch, it's not dainty to the point of old lady dainty. There's a huge difference! To me anyway... I hear dainty and I think old lady watch. I can say this is the perfect combination of dainty and stylish.  I thought this would be a 2 piece watch set, but it turns out that it's one. The simulated pearls wrap around your wrist while attached to the watch which makes it completely different. I like that...  You have the option of taking links out from both ends, which is good for me cause I have little wrists. If you have bigger wrists I don't think this is for you.  The clasp is great! It's a normal clasp so it shouldn't be great, but it is. I'll tell you why... I wore it, it came with a battery in it, and had to go get something out of my car. When I climbed into the backseat the watch got caught on the carpet that I had just bought. And it was STUCK. Not a regular carpet it was a shag. A gift for my neighbor. I tried to pull lightly and it didn't work. I had to YANK my hand so hard I though the pearls were going to go flying everywhere. But! They didn't. The clasp stayed shut, and you couldn't even tell that it had gone through as much as it did. I was laughing but more relieved than anything!  So. A well made watch that's pretty, with links to take out for the perfect fit and there is nothing to hate about the cute pink watch box with a pillow for the watch to lay on.  The butterfly is adorable, and the simulated pearl that is attached to the side of the watch is adorable. Even the prongs look well made.  At no point did this watch porn on my hair, irritate me, or get on my nerves. The cute rhinestone crystals that are in between the pearls are just the right amount of shine. Not overwhelming, and not underwhelming. I like that the pearls are accentuated with the crystals. Overall, it's adorable and I really like it.  I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review., My last two Seikos lasted twenty years apiece, withstanding very rough and deep treatment. This (my third) will not get nearly the use of my pevious divers (automatics each). This beastie seems to be constructed to the high standards I have come to expect from Seiko. It will probably never experience sea water, unless one of my sons gets it as a bequest. I did leave it in shallow water for seventy two hrs. I've had it for a month now and it has kept perfect time (to the second). The stopwatch funtion, for me, is superfluous but seems to function flawlessly. The solar powered operation is functioning as advertised. As for longevity I will probably never know, unless it comes to an untimely end before I do.<br />  The only fault I have been able to determine is the bezel turns too easily and has been turned upon being bumped. It (as it should be)  has a counter clockwise only movement so, if you still depend on your watch for underwater time management, it will only shorten your expired time giving you a good safety margine., THE &#34;J&#34; MODEL HAS ARIBIC SECOND LANGUAGE. THE &#34;K&#34; MODEL HAS SPANISH SECONDARY. BOTH USE THE SAME MOVEMENT.  SPRING FOR THE &#34;J&#34; FOR THE BETTER FIT AND FINISH AND THEREFORE THE ADVERTISED &#34;MADE IN JAPAN&#34;. I DON'T OWN ONE YET BUT JUST FINISHED A WEEKS RESEARCH COMPARING FEILD TESTS OF A LITTLE KNOWN WATCH COMPANY CALLED MARATHON THAT SUPPLIES SAR (SEARCH AND RESCUE) WATCHES FOR MILITARY RESCUE DIVERS.

YOU'LL BE DEAD BEFORE ANY OF THESE WATCHES FAIL AT SEA!<br />[[ASIN:B004U3ZIV4 MARATHON WW194006 Swiss Made Military Diver's Automatic Watch with Tritium]], Bought this for my elderly mother.  She loves the watch however it does pinch her skin/hair when putting on and off.  She leaves on day and night so not a real big issue for her., The face started fogging up the first week I wore it.  Very disappointed.  I am returning watch.  I really liked the watch, but it was defected., [[ASIN:B003YD5K4G Colibri Pocket Watch Gold Tone Mother of Pearl 586003]]<br /><br />This is a beautiful pocket watch!  The large gold numerals against the white face make it very easy to read.  It is also very light so you don't notice it in your pocket.  I adjusted it to Central Daylight time when it arrived and it has stayed on time ever since.<br /><br />I noticed some reviews talking about the chain clasp.  I have worn pocket watches for years and all but one of the chains had the same type of clasp.  I do not use the chains.  They are replace with a leather strap to hold my watch fob.  My point being to not worry about the chain clasp., Great product so far very solid and I have worn it swimming etc. update. The watch is sitting on my dresser. The pin to the strap fell out. I have reached out to the seller and manufacturer and have had no answer. Still a nice watch but cannot wear. Seller please contact me and let's sort this out, This is my 3rd one, perfect for me. Hope they don't discontinue them. Durable and holds up while working in a dusty/muddy ranch environement, This is my third one over a period of maybe 15 years. Inexpensive, plenty of features, easy to use, very accurate, durable, and the battery lasts a long time. Less obtrusive and ostentatious than many watches that seem popular at this time. Depends on your taste., Bought this watch to replace same model that I have had almost 2 years working flawlessly. Still working on same battery. Gets pretty rough treatment but &#34;keeps on ticking&#34;.  Replaced it because the band broke and it's almost as much to replace the band as a new watch., this watch is even better than I expected...the recipient is so thrilled with it., HAD A SMALL ISSUE WITH ITEM RECIEVED...CINDY AT JIDETECH REPLACED ITEM ...NO QUESTIONS ASKED...5 STARS TO JIDETECH AND CINDY...THANK YOU KEVIN, Beautiful watch, I totally love it, look great on my wrist, perfect size. I always receive compliments., Perfect watch for work! Looks expensive but isn't., Came wonderfully packaged and brand new., This is not an up-market watch, but it worked flawlessly for my recent snorkeling trip. I recommend it., I bought this watch to replace the exact same one. I kept the same one for almost ten years and its the best watch I've ever had...I work in the hospital and have had pts try to rip this off its very durable, its got the option for two times so I keep one set to military time which I need for documenting at work...its waterproof, not clunky...I've never managed to set the alarm but i dont really need it. Its an exceptionally great timepiece., The review by Dave Evans is spot on.  I wanted a watch with some color and this fits the bill nicely.  It was between this and the red strap solar expert.  I saw both in person and ended up with the orange.  It is a watch that attracts attention especially in this color.  I have received many compliments on it.  The color makes this a casual watch and I don't wear it with more business-like attire.  The contrast of the dial and hands make this a very readable watch.  I agree that the LCD can be hard to read in certain lighting conditions but this is a minor quibble.  I do wish the hands illuminated (glowed) for those times in the evening when I just don't have enough light.  I think the a brightness setting (high or low) on the light would be helpful.  It's lightweight and very comfortable.  The watch face is big.  My wrist is a little over 7 inches in diameter and it fits nicely without the lugs extending over the edges of my wrist.  If you are considering it and have a smaller wrist, I'd try it on first at a department store or jewelry store to make sure it isn't too big.  Overall, I'm happy with this purchase.  UPDATE: After some time with the watch, I've discovered that the hands do glow but the lume is not very strong unless immediately out of the light.  This may be due to the color as I believe orange doesn't carry lume well.  From a practical standpoint, while they do illuminate, I have found that I need to use the light on the display if I really want to know the time., We just received this today, very fast shipping and arrived in perfect condition.  Easy to hang, not too heavy.  We found it needed to chime out its first hourly strikes before the quarterly kicked in, so wait for that before deciding the clock doesn't chime properly.  Chimes sound beautiful and ineed chime quarterly as well as on the hour.  We are very happy with this purchase!, A beautiful watch, exactly what I ordered at a good price. Delivery time was satisfactory, considering typical postal and customs delays., Beautiful watch!, My first automatic... Surprisingly, it survived 18 hours sitting idle after which it was still running, so my biggest fear of having to set the time every time i wear a different watch was handled. It was a struggle to get the links out for adjustment (compared to any Seiko or Casio), had to get a watch repair person to do it for me. In my opinion, the luminous hands were easy to see, better than a Casio but not as good as a Seiko. the watch band is high quality and doesn’t move around much (making an annoying sound which my SKA605 makes). For any first-timer like me, you have to un-screw the crown and it will pop-out a little after which you can pull it to step 1 and step 2... Invicta should really mention this in the manual too. clasp has a safety lock which is very hard, but hopefully it will loosen up after a few months., doesn't work with larger watches..., Directions for setting too complicated.  Too many buttons...  Color not as described., A very nice leather watch band, it really looks good on my Seiko SNK803 watch., A wrist watch is both a utilitarian time-telling device and a wearable accessory – a bracelet, of sorts. Tastes vary and there is really no accounting for taste when it differs from our own. That being said:<br /><br />This is, quite possibly the perfect watch for a large, left-handed man. For an average size man (which, at 5”10” and about #170, I consider myself to be) this 10020-01-BRW Highlander from Swiss Legend is apt to be experienced as a bit of an over-weight and over-sized albatross which can, of course, tell you the time.<br /><br />From the tip of the crown (the piece that pulls out to adjust the time and date) to the far edge of the watch at 3 o’clock, the distance is a full 2 ¼”. This diameter would be more normative in an average-sized pocket watch – meant to be worn on a chain and not on a wrist. The depth of the watch is a ½ inch. Consider these measurements against those of a watch you have and like to wear. If they seem extreme, this is not the timepiece for you. It is ‘masculine’ (hoping that no large woman will take umbrage)  – it is virile (so states the advertising) – and it is BIG.<br /><br />Its design is noteworthy in a couple of important respects beyond the sheer mass of it. The three controls (crown and 2 push-buttons) are situated on the left side of the watch, rendering adjustments nearly impossible for a right-handed person without taking the watch off. As a guitar player, I liken this to giving a right handed person a guitar strung and set up for a left-handed person and expecting them to play it as though everything was just fine. It isn’t.<br /><br />Mechanically, the watch appears sound and, at least for an initial week or keeping an eye on it (and wearing it several times) it keeps accurate time. I cannot comment on its accuracy over an extended period. The buttons and crown controls work as described in the (most welcome) printed manual that accompanies this watch in a plush cushioned box.<br /><br />Being a wrist-watch enthusiast (I own and wear 12 of them) I have seen large watches before and am aware that mounting the adjustment controls and crown on the left side of the watch seems like a good idea to some people – I must assume they are mostly “Lefties” trying to make their own needs and preferences more of a standard.<br /><br />In this world, I do believe that there is something for everyone. If there is a large left-handed man on your Christmas list (who likes accessories consistent with his size) this watch is worth considering … Or, perhaps for a small person who wants to look, somehow, “big time.”t (I own and wear 12 of them) I have seen large watches before and am aware that mounting the adjustment controls and crown on the left side of the watch seems like a good idea to some people – I must assume they are mostly “Lefties” trying to make their own needs and preferences more of a standard.<br /><br />In this world, I do believe that there is something for everyone. If there is a large left-handed man on your Christmas list (who likes accessories consistent with his size) this watch is worth considering … Or, perhaps for a small person who wants to look, somehow, “big time.”, Very  very  classic,  the blue tone did it all, I took it to  MK store  and  got some  links  taken  out  for free. A little  heavy but perfect  for me., My favorite watch! I am wearing it as a write this review in fact. The time sets itself to the exact second, and the compass works great! I am not a weather expert, so as for the barometer, I assume it works correctly. The thermometer is effected by your body heat, so to get an accurate reading you have to take your watch off for a while. [To those out there who break things easily]- This is the watch for you. I have smashed this thing countless times and it's still fine!, Got this to wear while flying. Climbing around the airplane doing pre-flight checks, didn't want to be constantly banging up my mechanical Tissot; also wanted a watch I could have both local and &#34;Zulu&#34; time set on. This is a dual timezone watch; I leave one timezone set to UTC and the analog hands (and the &#34;other&#34; digital display, set separately) set to local time. There's a usable backlight and the hands are luminous for a while after light goes away. There's a stopwatch feature I've used a couple of times. It's overall a pretty good watch. Only real complaints: (1) The digital time can be nigh impossible to read behind the analog hands; and (2) setting the analog hands is a tedious process, though you only have to do it twice a year., Now let's be perfectly clear here. This is not a true Tourbillion movement. Tourbillion movements cost thousands of dollars, and are produced by skilled watchmakers, as these are one of the most difficult watch complications to make. If you want to look at a beautiful Tourbillion movement, look at one of Jaeger Le Coultre Tourbillion movements, then gasp at the price tag, lol. Inexpensive watchmakers are mounting the balance wheel on the face of the watch and are calling them Tourbillion movements. This however, is a nice little watch. Has a 22 jewel Asian automatic movement. Has working moon phase, 24 hour hand, and red second hand above the balance wheel. It is a stainless steel case with exhibition back so you can see the movement. The rotor is even stamped, so it lends it a little more class than a plain rotor. The automatic winding is as quite as I've ever heard in an automatic watch, no ratchety winding noise. Quiet. Tinted mineral glass crystal. The band fits well, and looks good but is PU leather, so I put a new Hadley-Roma leather strap on it. It looks even better now. Keeps good time, only gaining about a minute or so a week, which should even out with more wear. For 43 bucks you could do worse. Has no date. Good looking watch. Nice retro looks, big, but not gaudy big, as big watches are &#34;in&#34; now., Works better than some high end watch winders, Its ok, the chain broke the first day, its too flimsy.  I just use the watch part. Not really what I was looking for., Love this model. It's cool to have the timer and stopwatch, barometer, world time. I has two and ordered another just now.<br />The first watch band broke.<br />The second watch leaked in a swimming pool. It happened outside the warrantee period!<br />Because they are only $40 I'm happy to get another.<br />But beware!, Worth it, Too loose on my wife's arm. And it looks better in the picture than in person. But other than that the return was really easy to deal with thanks, This watch looks exactly like the picture. It's not a Rolex but it is a pretty watch you can wear everyday and not have to worry about. I bought this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. Time is keeping good so far.  I would recommend this product. I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for an honest review., This is my favorite watch and gets so many compliments.  Unfortunately, shortly after receiving the watch one band broke.  Recently the second band broke so I can't secure the watch band or wear the watch.  I wish I could get replacement part, Larger than expected., stopped working, outstanding, Its very good option to buy, elegant and cute smartwatch, it was awesome, The best, The material is extremely cheap. It broke the next day, I was pleasantly  surprised with this watch...very vintage looking..I love vintage jewelry...the abalone inserts added a beautiful touch to the marcasite stones...the only problem...the bracelet had to be adjusted...the pins are sooo small that only a jeweler could adjust the wrist bands...I do recommend this product., Nothing fancy, lightweight and attractive!, Wasn't the quality I had expected, Top!, Exact replacement for my vintage Seiko dive watch. I decided to inspect my spring bars after many years of service, I'm glad I did. The internal springs were fatigued and were holding only by corrosion, sure way to lose a watch. The new spring bars from JP Leather works are well finished and machined perfectly., Better than the bang-around watch I expected., Very elegant, Absolutely amazing! Love the watch!! Nothing I could dislike about it! Wish I could give it 100 stars! I changed the band because I'm not a fan of leather bands but the watch is perfect!! Six days and hasn't lost a second! Got a spring bar tool set and love switching up the bands, great watch for any occasion, even took it to a water park. UPDATE- It looses a second a week. Still a great watch! I've had it for about three weeks or so and it's still my favorite in my collection! I put the seiko &#34;monster watch&#34; metal band on it and it looks even better!, I am very happy with my new watches., Okay, my bad!  I did not read these reviews before I bought this watch.  The reviews are consistently true.<br />The numbers on the outside rubbed off within a few days.  The watch band was too big so I cut it off and re-sewed it to make it fit.  After I had cut the band I noticed the letters missing.  Eh!  My grandson loves his batman watch design, but it doesn't look like this picture.  I WOULD NOT purchase this watch again!!, Very cute, I like the look and everything but was disappointed that it needed a battery and the instructions didn't explain how to set the date. I shouldn't have to spend more money for a battery for a brand new watch., It's ok it keeps stopping not happy. Good thing I have my phone for time., Cool, This watch is perfect.  It's shiny and really nice looking on your wrist.  I have an average size wrist and it is just the right amount of loose.  I think it will be easy to read but not worried about it.  For me it's more jewelry.  I really love it and it was priced right.  This is my second Anne Klein and I have not been disappointed yet.  The shipping was also very fast.  Thank you I am a happy customer., This clock didn't work. I don't know if it was a faulty mechanism or a dead battery.<br />Also, only the numbers and the very tips of the hands are painted with glow-in-the-dark material. The clock is tiny. So I couldn't see what time it is in the dark. Useless. I think the hands should have glowed too. Luckily I was able to return it., The amount of detail in this authentic Bulova watch speaks for itself. The watch looks almost exactly as the picture portrays it.<br /><br />The watch is fairly easy to adjust with the proper tools and looks sharp once properly fitted. This is obviously not a watch you would wear to a BBQ, but is perfect for the office or formal events.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Note: Other retailers will charge much more then what is offered on Amazon. This is a great deal., I like this product!, The watch arrived in excellent condition, however I've had a couple of big issues with it. The first is that during some afternoons the watch's day window will switch to it's non-English language option and stay there until adjusted. Second, after wearing the watch for three weeks, it began to run slow. Because Amazon is not a Luminox authorized dealer, the watch's 2-year warranty is invalid. Therefore, it will cost $55 at a minimum (that is if the battery only needs to be replaced) to have it fixed. Not something I wanted to pay for after owning the watch for just over a month..., The watch in general is a beautiful piece, as a real bulova stuff, a just have one suggestion, they should post a picture of the side size of the watch, since it is higher than expected., Very elegant, excellent, Not top quality, but it works for the occasional repair., It's a nice watch overall. I'm returning it because it's way too big. it looks like a man's watch., Not teal and dead battery-tried to change battery-could not back off., I like this clock, the style is what I was looking for.  Two things - the instructions for setting time/alarm, etc are light at best, just symbols and pictures.<br />The other is that I can't read the time in the dark, the hands glow but not enough to be useful, at least for me.  I also don't like the constant green or amber glow, so I turned that off.  To read the time in the dark I press the snooze bar, and while holding it down, the light glows so I can tell if the alarm is on or off, and also what time it is., I like the design of the band but it is really large. The watch face has a shiny back which makes it a bit hard to read the time when in brighter light. I could deal with all of that but I gave it a low score because I have had to reset the time ever day., Thank You, The watch band was nice and time, but there were no spring pin with the watch band., I found this watch and after telling my fiancé about this, she bought it for me. I knew the moment I got it that it was now the favored watch of my collection. I've owned more expensive watches but none with more value. If you can get over the fact that you're only paying $200 for it, its weight, quality and design and impressive. However, its not perfect. Its still so appreciated that it deserves 5 stars imo but there are drawbacks. For one, realize you're buying a massive watch. I'm not typically into modern, wide face, gigantic gaudy watches...this watch only gets a pass because its not really gaudy, its fine, somewhat minimalistic and artistic. But it is gigantic and wide faced. Its cumbersome at times. I have to take it off to type on my laptop which makes it impractical to wear all day through without removing it once or twice. It also has a way of jumping out and smacking against things you walk by, unless you're accustomed to wearing a watch this deep, wide and heavy. I'm slowly getting used to that. I've also had problems with the accuracy of the hands. The hour hand is never precisely where it should be, its too far back in time. When its 10:30, the hour hand will just be on 10. I can reset the watch forward a few times but that just means I'll have the same problem 2 days later. If you're finicky, this may be more of an issue but again, I give this watch a lot of passes for its aesthetics and durability. I truly can't say if this is the case with all &#34;perpetual motion&#34; watches but it doesn't hold energy for long. You have to either wear this watch every other day or resign yourself to re-setting it when you put it on. It runs out of energy within 2 to 3 days depending on how much I wear it before putting it away. It is more than adequate once put on. Once you set it and put it on your wrist, it wont stop moving until you put it away for a bit. In the end, I've heard more positive remarks on this watch than any other I've had. People tell me its the nicest watch they've ever seen. It really is clever and un-obtuse for an Invicta which often goes for sheer volume of flash and size; this model has a bit more foresight aesthetically than typical. Some of my other friends with Invictas can really only wear them to a night on the town or else risk someone in the normal world ridiculing them (me included) for wearing a screaming grandfather clock. My first time really out with it was on a boat in Newport where everyone around me by default was successful or part of a successful household and it drew compliments from all manner of people (the better part of them certainly more successful than myself). This watch does have a dignified bearing about it, still a little showy but in the end pretty well dignified... Its both a skeleton AND a perpetual motion watch meaning the clockwork is very lean and minimal, you should expect that it is not as perfect mechanically; however it does suffice functionally and you can't argue with a pretty face... If you're an aspiring rapper, you'll like that it comes with an MSRP price tag attached that says $1995 on it, just leave it hanging so no one has to ask., OK, We had this watch for only 1 month and then it broke. The outside red circle thing was able to be twisted around (not sure if it is supposed to do that) My son wore it to school one day and came home crying because it fell apart while he was doing his math center. The red ring came off and then the plastic that housed the watch hands came off so we had to throw it in the garbage., COOL, Awesome watch from Citizen here. The chrono is accurate, it looks great on the wrist and has a good solid feel and weight to it. If I were to change anything on this it would be the band that does rattle a bit and feels cheap., It is so beautiful, not sure how well it keeps time but it needs to be wound every 24 hours.  The pics of it are very accurate., I have a Guess Collection watch that I bought before I was married back in 1998.  I bought the watch at Macy*s on 34th street for $200.  I've had the watch for 17 years and its still in tack.  Everything is still working like back in 1998.  I saw this watch and I had to get it.  It was original $450.00<br />and I bought it for $250., I just could not like this get away.  I'm keeping my eyes on another of Guess Collection watches, but it's $550.00.  Just waiting for the price to go way dooown.  I've have had lots of people stopping me to ask what kind of watch is that, and I let then know what kind of watch it is.  It's worth the money and time to buy this watch.  You won't regarded it!<br />Ramfis, I really like my watch, but the outside bezel came off immediately after I opened the box. I did slip some gorilla glue under it to stabilize it. I have now had the watch for over a year and love it. But you will have to do some fix up., COOL, I had several ironman watches over the years. This one is the best because the band is the thinnest. It does not even bother me during a yoga session., Bought one for my self and its very nice looking but just a little hard to read in direct sun light at times.<br />I then bought one for my friend and I hate it, it came scratch up like its used and the watch it self was now black and not silver like the exact same one I bought before, Better than what I expected!!, So glad to have a new Citizen watch!, Beautiful watch - my wife loves it!  Nice quality as usual with Fossil, and the size is easy for her to see without being too big.  Very pleased - it was a big hit for her birthday!, awesome!  the only problem is no problem. i just need a tuff watch that will keep the time. this thing<br />does whole lot of stuff i don't need,. but if i ever do?<br />thank you!, As other reviewers have noted, the watch just won't stay white. I'm on my second one, and this time I actually got a person from Support at Timex on the phone. Apparently this is a known problem with their resin bands - even if you never wear sunscreen or anything else, it's going to turn orange gray on you. Because of this, they sell replacement bands (like $20), but although it's a good watch, I'm getting tired of running to the jewelers (no you can't replace it yourself) or buying a new one every 6 months. Time to try something else., Trash , dont buy this item, My all time favorite watch! Has everything I need, and a few things I don't, but is still so simple to understand. Really is waterproof, Ive gone snorkeling with it on, I sweat all over this thing, and i wear it in the showers. the one I wear now I've used for two years, the one before that 6 months and I only replaced it because i lost it. If I wanted to buy another watch just to have diversity and switch them every so often I would just buy another one of these of the same color. I recommend it to everyone, Well, it's probably okay, because it was delivered within a reasonable time (coming all the way from China) and does look exactly like the picture. However, none of the tiny screws actually fit ANY of my glasses. So for me, it is completely useless. Too bad., JUST OKAY, Nearly identical to another aviator watch that sells for over $100.  Like this one better because it is polished vs brushed.  The day function is really cool., perfect, I like it very much!, My husband loves this watch.  In his career he goes back and forth between inside and outside all day.  He is a boat salesman so we needed a watch that could withstand being wet and sweaty and this is perfect for that! The band is not effected at all when it gets wet or sweaty.  He is very tough on stuff and this lasted him all summer.  He recently fell and it caught on something and the clasp broke off, but it would have with any watch. We are planning on buying the same watch again to replace the one that broke., Elegant, I love it!<br /><br />But the strap is a little bit short., The compass feature with the crown knob on the left side is useless., No watch at all, only an empty box., I had to return it as it several large scratches. I was not impressed by its quality.  Ended up buying a different model., I like this item.  It did not fit around my husband's wrist.  I had to send it back because it pinched his wrist.  My husband has a very big weist and I need a super big wrist band for him to wear the watch., 'So disappointing this watch no longer features an Indiglo light-up face. My son loved his old one, but this one is just 'blah'. And yeah, go ahead and order the replacement batteries- you'll need it within a few months of purchase., Purchased this watch for a formal event as I like to wear something different each time I go somewhere.<br /><br />I must say the watch looks great in person and goes well with any formal or semi-formal wear. I wouldn't wear it as a daily watch as it would be overkill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Elegant detailed face<br />- Presentation: packaged like a more expensive watch<br />- Sturdy watch band<br />- Accurate hands with ability to set the current day<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Not sure if it's just my particular watch, but the clasp has opened unintentionally a few times<br />- Selecting the day can be tricky as it can change when you push the dial in once selected (you have to be precise and not spin the dial at all once you pick the day)<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone, especially someone who doesn't have this style of watch in their collection yet or is debating picking one up for an upcoming formal event. You will not be disappointed., Excellent quality, no hair pulling on wrist, fits the Seiko diver perfectly., A very accurate watch. It loses about 3 seconds per month. I've owned at least 6 of this model and only one was not this good. Highly recommended., I guess everybody has had one or two of these in the time they have been around. This is the first one I've had that was not either too big or too small--it's &#34;just right&#34; for me. As usual, more features than a person really needs but reliable and pretty much bombproof. It is NOT as large as the men's version, and very light and comfortable on the wrist., Just perfect and a much nicer watch than I expected for the price.  I can see where a man with a big wrist might have a problem.  But personally I love it, Very easy to use!, The leather strap is difficult to fit on the hand. And the clock inside was twisted. It didn't face the right direction so you cannot read the time, I love the look of the face of this watch. It's super unique with the wood grain and looks just as good as the photo. I believe the quality is good (though it will take some time to tell). I'm also a fan of their sunglasses.<br /><br />The only issue I had is the watch strap is waaay too long and it's not adjustable on one side, so you can tighten it to where you need, but then the end of the strap comes all the way back around to face of the watch and looks a bit funny. Once I replace the band, it won't be an issue., This appears even more delicate in person. It is a very pretty watch and even with the gems, has a classy look to it., It's awesome but the compass is a joke you have to set it where ever you are and that's not the way it should work other than that it's good, loved this one so much I ordered similar watches that were available- Comfortable, and easy to wear and read. don't understand all the buttons, but that's okay, Present for young girl....she is happy with it., I like the charm bracelet, but the watch stopped working only a few days after I my husband gave it to me. The problem is that it doesn't take a battery, so it's an old fashioned style, but you can't wine it up, or replace a battery., I believe to be all I thought.  The band is a little hard to get off because of the rubber to rubber contact.  However it is actually a lot easier to read than I thought., This is a great looking watch and the woodgrain is beautiful. The hands and hour marks are illuminated and the date window is easy to set on the correct date. It's surprisingly light weight and can hardly be felt when you're wearing it. The pins in the links however, we're very difficult to remove and one of the links broke while trying to remove it. Luckily it was the link that was being taken off. All in all, it's a great time piece for the price, and looks 100 times better in person., This is a very nice watch for the price.  The band and watch feel and look good.  It is a men's watch.  At this price, I wasn't concerned that the quality be perfect.  There is some spotting on the Mickey face and ears where the paint isn't all there.  The spots are tiny and you have to look close to see.  For me, that was worth the cheaper price., My husband is a watch expert. He owns an impressive collection of watches by top brands. He ordered this watch winder for his collection.<br />The winder looked nice and was easy to use, however it made a lot of noise and winding system did not work very well. We ended up returning it and purchasing much more expensive winder., The Casio watch is really comfortable, simple, but elegant! The only bad thing is the light that doesn't light that well. Plus the watch is too small. But it's good for the price 👌🏻, Somewhat bigger than passed watches I've purchased. Easy to set, keeps accurate time. Very nice leather band also. So far love it., Awesome. Velcro is tough. Im a Vet Tech and I need a watch that can take some beatings and possibly a bite or 2 to protect my wrist. This watch does the trick., Awesome watch., I purchased this for a second time after I lost my first one. Everything about this watch is great – just make sure you really push down hard on the clamps to secure it to your wrist! I've worn mine everyday for half a year now and I don't see the mesh bracelet wearing out unlike what others have experienced. I only wished they had an alternate version of this design with a date display., 5 years with the Timex Weekender and still a great watch.  One week with the Timex Expedition Scout and it no longer works. Time adjustment knob fell off., This watch is awesome!  I bought it for my husbands birthday and he loved it!  It's very cool looking !  Looks very stunning on. Classy ! I wasn't at all sure of the brown wrist band but it's beautiful!  Great buy !, Fantastic!!!, Looks fashionable and is comfortable to wear.  Downside: the buttons in that they are very small and difficult to press if you have large fingers, especially the stopwatch reset (top left).  I am unable to press any of the buttons while wearing gloves.  The watch looks durable, but in reality its a basic digital timepiece surrounded by a one mm thick piece of matt black plastic., This is the swatch watch to end all swatch watches. You can't buy a swatch that represents the essence of swatch more than this. Super cool. Definitely a conversation starter! And the quality of swatch is awesome., The face is too small as well as the bank....thought both would be much larger., Good looking sport watch, goes well for a man on the go. Thanks, I love this item and the price was very good. However, it does not seem to keep time. Once I have set the correct time later in the day i will look and and it is either several hours ahead or behind. I thought maybe i had not pushed the pin in all the way when setting the time but after doing so i still experienced the same issue., love it.. clasp a bit cheap, but overall, good looking watch.., Pretty Nice watch and affordable price. I really like the design, SO COOL, Great watch. This is my first metal bracelet watch and it is very comfortable to wear. The face is easy to read and it just looks manly. The only criticism I have is that the date window is RIDICULOUSLY tiny. Virtually unreadable. And the dark gray color is wearing off the bracelet where my arm rests on my desk at work. The waterproofing works as advertised, as I wore it while body surfing with adverse effects to the watch. Overall a very nice watch for the price., Clock hands quick working this week. Put new batteries in it but the hands still will not work. For the price we paid, I would have thought the clock would have lasted longer!, The watch was a gift for my little sister and she liked it very much; it flashes a lot in a dark room!! It fits her nice because this watch has a 35 mm case diameter, which is fine for her cause she has small hands and wrists. Good product., We received the watch winder about two weeks ago, to this point everything is working great. I looks very handsome and is easy to operate., I returned this item the 1st time because digital numbers do not work.  Received a replacement with the exact same problem., Amazing watch!, Came broken had to send back, Its delivered quicker than the estimated time which I am surprised! The quality is good despite there are some stains inside the box and i like it so much overall!, I love the design. I think it looks better than the new breitling military watch. I'm glad I did some research before the purchase., Horrible buy!!! It always stayed behind time. I could not trust this watch to tell me the time so I put it away. For a few month I checked on the time it displayed and about a couple month in, it was an hour behind. I bought the orange version :\\ oh boy did it get dirty... Carry soap around for this reason. I'm sure some people have soap on them. Another con is the material the band is made of. I have never had any skin reaction to any material that had came in contact with my skin except this watch. Rashes, burn, itch, etc. I used it for a month but kept it for over a year, it always showed the wrong time. The light is dimmed and scattered. Finally I gave it to a homeless man who said he doesn't care about the time. After all it can be only used as a collectible item., a little cheaper looking than I expected.But it seems to keep good time. I have only had it a few days so I am not really sure of it., The band was better quality than the original watch band  and am very pleased to have the new one,  It is also less expensive than what you find in the local stores, Typical, I received my Stuhrling Original black dial watch in a very nice and secured packaging not to mention the fast shipment. Please refer for photo of the watch from other reviewers. Although a bit small (42mm) since I'm used to wear size 47mm+ this watch is very nicely built and very attractive for the price. I recommend it to those looking for stylish but affordable with a touch of elegance watch... can be an everyday watch if preferred. Buy it and judge it yourself. Thanks again Amazon!, watch is too heavy. bought it for my father., No light or illuminated hour and minute hands.  Can't read at night in the dark.  Keeps great time and is sleek, but doesn't do much good if you can't see what time it is., For some reason I never wrote a review, but I've had this watch for almost 2 years now, and it never fails to earn me compliments. I've worn it nearly every day, have accidentally worn it in the ocean and in pools, and it has not yet shown me trouble. The indiglo light faded about 2 months ago, but that's totally OK in comparison to the time this watch has proved useful. Its worth the price, I swear., Great watch, low price. I bought it because it shows the date and has a bright indiglo feature. It says waterproof and suitable for swimming and showering. I wanted a watch to wear out at the lake or kayaking that can get wet and I don't have to worry about it (not planning on scuba diving with it.) Or if I lose it or break it at least the price is low enough that I'll be disappointed but will live to see another day!, Identical replacement from Casio.  Perfect!, i like it., I bought the watch and wore it at work only for a month... and the black color started to peel!! I have a desk job (it's not like i do heavy work) and i always take care of my stuff and use them delicately. Don't buy from this seller. I sent them an email and they never responded. Such a disappointment!!!, I bought this for my boyfriend and it was a hit, particularly the stitching on the sides. It is kind of bulky though.. more so than expected but not more than I guess most men's watches are.  NOTE: when I bought it I thought the face was dark blue (it looks blue on my computer) but it's actually black.. still very nice., This watch is every bit as elegant and understated in real life as in the listing. One thing to note is that I am a man with somewhat slender wrists, and the band size is perfect for me. If your wrist is of a more sturdy dimension, you may need a larger band., It was a HUGE HIT WITH MY 7 year old son. The only reason I'm giving it 4 and not 5 stars, is the battery was practically dead. Still it was a huge hit., COOL, While the watch looks very nice, the numbers are very hard to read except in certain light.  Since I wanted to wear this every day, it would not work for me and I sent it back., I bought this for my boyfriend because his watch broke. It looks nice for the price I paid but it's nothing fancy. He has said he gets a lot of compliments on it., Wow, what a great watch! Sooo cool, and gorgeous with the diamonds! Incredible deal! I am so happy I bought this watch; I get a TON of compliments!, excellent!!!, Thanx, This is a very nice box, the quality of the workmanship is excellent, the high gloss coat makes the wood seem like it is hand rubbed to perfection. The hidden hinges are a nice touch, & the hidden magnets keep the box closed with just the right amount of tension. The wood has a rich grain that stands out, and is beautiful to the eye. The interior matches the quality of the box, it feels like a high quality leather, very soft to the touch, although I'm not sure if it is leather, or if it is &#34;pleather&#34;, (Plastic Leather&#34;), regardless it seems to me that this box would be worth it, at double the price....., Product is as expected., Arrived on time, and quite cute!, perfect., slim and elegant, Excellent seller and product!, Because 1. the analog portion of the watch was defective, 2. the digital portion of the watch had a poor display, and 3. the function buttons for the digital watch made little sense... I had to give this watch one, solitary, star. If it didn't look so good, I would have given it a zero! Returned it to Amazon for a refund 😞, I wouldn't recommend this to everybody, but for the last month I've been timing my laps swimming on it.  After my first set, I whip my goggles off, check the split, press the buttons, and do another set of laps.  Have had no problems with the water getting into the watch, it's been a dream.  I wouldn't recommend this for everybody, but I wanted to push the limits a little bit and see how this held up., Simple.  No Frills.  Classic!, It's too big 😡, this clock is pretty awesome. Looks good and has a perfect size for your desk. Definitely worth the money. Glad I purchased one., I order a 2 tier and got one tier !! Rip off, complete satisfaction, Great watch band, but I am disappointed by 2 things:<br />1. The silver buckle is too big. I wish it didn't flare out.<br />2. The nylon is only a thin layer. This is a black leather watch band with a thin layer of nylon on top and a thin tan leather layer underneath.<br />Overall I'm happy with this band, but I'm going to look for another full nylon band in the future., This is a very nice watch. It fits the wrist well and is subtle but still has a stylish face. The band is made of leather but has a somewhat cheap look which really does this time piece a disservice and this is the reason I can't give it 5 stars. I'm on the look out for a band that befits the build quality of this watch to make it perfect., Beautiful, elegant, and goes with everything!  Love it!!!, I picked this watch up with the TW2P71500. Immediately I put a normal leather band on it, this band was nice - but I prefer an normal band. I really like the blue face, it's a darker navy. The numbers are white, the hands are silver. This is the one thing I would change about the watch - and something I didn't initially consider. It's not a deal breaker, but with the white numbers I'd prefer the continuous look of the white hands on the chrono dials and overall. It's a great watch overall, it doesn't tick as loud as the smaller (both in thickness and dial size) Weekenders. I have tried to listen for the normal Timex tick, but unless right up next to my ear it's not noticeable.<br /><br />Great watch, I'd recommend. It's moved to near the top of my watch choices., Ordered this great watch and enjoyed everything about it. For something that was brought on a deal making it less than $40, It was really worth the purchase. Since I'm satisfied with it. 5 stars to the watch. Would recommend to anyone, Beauty, elegance, and functionality all in one package. The slim side profile makes this watch ride low on the wrist. There's just no bulkiness to it. Though the face is fairly large, it is offset by the slender nature of the remaining watch characteristics. Arrives in a very nice metal box that's worth keeping., Good value and very comfortable.  A little concerned about the longevity.  Seems a little delicate., I love the looks of this watch. It is easy to read and the band is very comfortable., the box looks like fake seiko, I love this watch!  It's perfect!  I get many compliments on it. It's easy to read., I get so many compliments on this watch, I just love it.  I was hesitant on buying it on amazon but it was a great deal and it is the real deal., I gave 5 stars for the value of a seiko watch at the price of a timex...<br />The watch is extremely light you won't remember your wearing it.<br />With it being rated for 30 meters makes it a good watch to wear lounging at pool or light snorkeling. .have put to mentioned test and so far so good.<br />Would recomended this watch, COOL, Amazing quality and arrived on time. The watch looks fancy and not cheap at all. Love it., Change color before I get a chance to wear it., Sorry to say that I bought this watch. Trusting amazon merchant place. Sadly the watch stopped working after ownership at 6 months. It sat on my dresser for another couple months. I thought it was just a battery. Finally took it it in and dicovered that there were more issues with it . It is not returnable even though it's been lees then 12 months. What's the deal with that! It seems like this wad not a new watch when sold to me. But poorly reconditioned!!!, Absolutely love wearing this watch.  It's the same watch I had back in the 80s when I was 13 years old.  Wish Casio would keep overall look but add update such as backlight and other minimal features.  But even without this the watch is pretty good., Beautifully eye catching watch ...... Works well ... Wht more ✔, Watch is gorgeous -- one HUGE problem..... it doesn't tick.  Yep ---- doesn't work.  I'm going to have to take it to a watch shop and get a new battery put in -- I was shocked and disappointed -- hugely.  I was SO looking forward to receiving and wearing this right away --- but -- it doesn't work!  I couldn't believe it!  VERY SAD ----, POOOOOOR QUALITY, Good value.  Weakest part is the band.  This is my 3rd watch and all have eventually had the band  crack and split.  For the value I keep buying the watch., Bought this for my girlfriend. She's a watch collector of some higher end name brands. This watch looks better in person and is a great watch for any collector, Superb quality and design. Very lightweight., After I moved my 2015 short interest return past 50% I decided to reward myself with this beautiful watch., This is a very elegant wristwatch! I thought it was beautiful before I ordered it, but it is a knock out in person.<br />It keeps great time as well. I get lots of compliments!, Me encantó, Love the look and feel of this watch. It's a real attention getter, which is what I was looking for. Quality if very good for the price., OKAY, these were exactly what I needed to finish out a project., Nice watch for me.  Not too big on my wrist as so many are made these days.  Just right.  I love the band, very comfortable.  It took me awhile to get accustomed to a self winding watch as it's been years since I had one without a battery, but it's not bad at all.  My only dink is that the display appearance is a bit cluttered looking but I like having a day/date and moving second hand., I've only had the watch a couple of weeks but it is exactly what I had expected. It's a classic, no frills beautiful watch. Bold numbers. Nice, visible arms and date. For the price, so far, I'm very satisfied., I love my watch, the only bad thing is the the batery died after barely using it for 2 months., cheap watch to amuse son-never worked right, even after replacing, Just the right size and features, This watch is perfect!  Its not large like many other Michael Kors watches.  It is extremely beautiful and classy!  This order arrive extremely quickly despite paying for the cheapest shipping - I ordered it on Saturday and it arrive in Canada on Wednesday morning.  Very impressive!, This my second Expedition.  I like the size and easy to read face as well as the lighting.  Very durable and easy to wear., Great band! Worth the buy! Not for bigger wrists.. Fit my wrist just right!, perfect, like everything about it - nice clean look, weight (heavy, but not clunky), keeps good time, and receive more compliments on this watch than my victorinox chrono classic, which cost more and disappointingly filled with water after about a year and a half., The watch was OK but It lost over two minutes a day  Sent it back., Like it a lot......  Not a jump out and a little hard to tell time at night.  The hands don't light up., Beautiful color. accurate time., The watch looks great, don't get me wrong. However, the first day I received it I was disappointed to see that the battery was already dead., I was on the fence about this watch until it arrived. It's freaking gorgeous! A good buy for sure!, i would pay 40.00 for this watch, Not as advertised, Love the watch these bands fit.  The bands wear out so I stock up on these.  The watch is one of the thinnest and lightest I have seen.  Digital dial is easy to read., all products arrived in excellent condition thank you very much, all products arrived in excellent condition thank you very much, This is the worst watch...do not buy.  Moisture built up in it after less than 6 months.  I wasted time and money sending it back to be fixed.  A couple of months after I sent it in for repairs, it won't run at all.   This is a total waste of money.    What a scam., The watch arrived with a dead battery.  Taking the back off you can see how cheaply made it is.  It will work great for my costume but I'm not sure how long it would stand up to everyday use.  The cover is spring loaded so you don't have to worry about it flopping open, This is an amazing watch. I purchased it for a steep discount on Prime Day, but I would pay at least 2x what I paid that day.<br /><br />It is a LARGE watch, so be wary of that. I'm over six and a half feet tall, so it fits my wrist just fine, but even so, people can recognize how large it is. That happens to be a desired feature for me, but it might not be for you!<br /><br />OH! And this is really important! Setting the watch is not at ALL like it says it is in the included book. Here's how it works: you have a large dial on the right-hand side, and above that, a recessed button. Pulling the dial all the way out allows you to set the time, and that's how you set the day of the week as well - just spin the hands until you arrive at the correct day of the week (and time within that day). Keep in mind that, since the watch is tracking both the date and the day, you need to treat setting the watch like it's military time - there IS a difference between 10:15AM and 10:15PM! Just spin the hands to 12 o'clock and see if the day and date advance; you'll know which one is which then. To set the date, use a ball-point pen and click the recessed button in. Each click will move the date one forward. Definitely set the time and day before the date, as if you advance the hands enough, the date will of course move on its own.<br /><br />That should do it! Good luck!, I like the watch and the timer, and the back light. remember though, it is white. :/, If its to big here a sugestion take it to the jewlery store and have them remove a few link duhh did u think it was magicly gunna be your size, Great traditional looking watch.  I have a 10 year old Stuhrling watch that runs better and requires less maintenance than my Rolex Datejust, a $4,500 watch.  Hope this watch and the black faced one run lIke my old Stuhrling., My first impression of this watch was that it might a little too small. My previous watch was 43mm and this is a 41mm. However, after spending a day with it, the size is fine. I think it's the perfect size for a watch, not too big, not too small. I have a 7 inch wrist and it complements it nicely. The watch feels very premium and looks like it is of a higher quality than it is. It might not be made by Citizen, Seiko, etc, but this watch has a great mechanical movement and the finish is very nice and shiny. A deep luminous yellow. Probably the nicest finish I've ever seen on a watch. The dragon design and diamonds look very nice as well. Definitely worth the price for this piece of jewelry. The packaging is also very nice and comes with a great warranty and notes from the seller that show they stand by the product. However, some of the cons would be the watch resizer that comes with the watch. The links are stuck in pretty well and the resizer is very flimsy. I actually bent the resizer tip. You''ll basically have to get it resized by a jeweler. I took it to wal-mart and they could not resize it either. Also, some other minor flaws, if you look carefully on the picture, there are no diamonds on the 8 and 10 o clock hour spots. And the links in the bracelet aren't fully given a gold tone. The inside parts are still gray. Doesn't really bother me though because the finish that is visible is very nice and has no marks on it anywhere. Might not be a big brand watch, but deff one of a kind. Dragon, shiny flawless finish, shiny hands, mechanical movement, diamonds, great warranty, sapphire crystal. Worth the price., The watch came a day ahead of schedule! I love it, it's so comfortable and lightweight, and fits great on my tiny wrists! It's everything I thought it would be :), I wanted to like this watch, good clean design, low profile fits under dress shirts...  BUT the build quality felt quite cheap; very loose fit in all the pin joints in the link band. The watch would rattle and make chink noises.  Also, and this is a problem (in general) with link-style bands and smaller wrists, I just couldn't get this watch to fit comfortably.  one-link too big and slides about my wrist too much, one-link too few and it's locked in place cutting off blood circulation.  I returned this watch for another Skagen with a metal mesh band which i like much better now., This was a gift, This is not my first Ingersoll watch but is certainly a favorite amongst a rather large collection of many different brands. It has all the nice features, keeps excellent time for a mechanical watch, is sized right and wears comfortably even on my relatively small 7 1/4 inch wrist. Had always wanted one of these Bison 18's so, at this deeply discounted price, I couldn't pass it up, it was really cool looking, key word WAS, the latch is worthless and I lost it 2 days after receiving it., This watch practically looks like its made of water, so its a natural for anyone who is in water sports like my daughter.<br /><br />Its a simplistic watch, without too many functions, which is always good.  I think the display is a bit more crowded than it should be, with the &#34;days of the week&#34; on permanent display... I think that was a bit of overkill.<br /><br />At its price point, its a good watch for the money.  And the cute shiny bezel and overall good looks make it an easy choice., Not what I expected!!!, It is a nice watch but stopped keeping time after a couple of days. And sometimes it won't work unless I shake it., Fine for the price. I would recommend it to those who work a lot with their hands and go through watches like socks., Watch band is a joke. My son wore this watch for a couple hours before it loosened and fell off. Couldn't keep the band tight. Don't waste your money., It was four days late. However, I absolutely love this watch! I don't find it hard to read at all (I just read the digital part that says the time). Totally recommend it, I definitely want another one. Oh, and I'm tiny so I was worried it would be too big on my wrist, and it's not at all. Perfect size. :), This watch is heavy make no doubt about it. Hard to figure out all the settings. Trial and error for me. Once set it was fine. My watch jammed. I could not get anything to change. Nothing. This was about less than a year use. Have it but never tried to have it fixed. What I liked was the large numbers and letters. Easy to read and everything one could want comprised on one large face. You can change it just to the time. I like the way it is presented on Amazon. If you have a small wrist pass on it. If you have a large wrist and don't mind the weight it is worthy of consideration. Low pricing was why I got mine from Amazon., Horrible quality. I found many things going wrong after a while., I recently bought this watch for my teenager but when she picked up to wear it to her school today, the watch had stopped working 6 days ago!!! the date in the watch is Aug 21st and the watch is not working at all. This is the first time I have experienced with Amazon that I had bought a product through them and the product did not work. I am living in the Bahamas and I don't know how to get this fixed., Very cute but the band wrinkled after the first wear ... still working but crappy band..you get what you pay for, OWESOME WATCH I LIKE THE WAY THEY DESIGNED IT AND I LIKE THE COLOR COMBINATION TOO, THIS WACTH WAS ELEGANT, This watch is like a part of my body., amazing wrist piece, I am a huge rolex fan and this watch has completed my collection., I received this watch today and it is just beautiful in person.  The only problem is that the clasp links are so tight that it is almost impossible to open to put on your wrist.  I even posted a question on line thinking I was doing something wrong.  After working for a long time, I finally got one of them to pop open using a screwdriver and a lot of force.  I have been opening and closing it hoping it will loosen up or it is going to be tough to take off my wrist without assistance.  But, other than the tight clasp, it is a beautiful watch and worth the dollars., This is so much better than the rubber watch bands that always break., I thought the gold looked cheep, however, I have this watch in silver and love it.  Vendor accepted my return without issue., This watch is incredibly difficult to change sizes.  It also feels very cheaply made.  The metal finish came off when I was removing the plastic protector that it came with.  Clearly a cheap knock off made in China.  Don't recommend...spend an extra $10-$20., trusted seller. watch was perfect, This watch is actually a lot more petite than I expected. I definitely need my glasses to see the numbers so I could see where this wouldn't be large enough for some people to read easily. I'm 125lbs and had no problem getting this to fit on my wrist. Works great for my job as an EMT. Has the elapsed time dial as well as the date. Has lasted through blood, water rescues, and frequent hand washings so I'm happy. It does tend to absorb color from any fabrics it comes into contact with. Still, I would definitely buy this again. It's a good watch for the price., pink and white makes the watch look feminine but hip..., Broke right away, Very sturdy watch. I bought when teaching P.E in the Marshall Islands, as I needed a watch for class. So its life was spent in a salty, very humid environment where I was quite active and sweating. I also did a lot of free diving, and wore this watch every time down to depths of 70 feet.<br />It never got in the way, and the rotating bezel was great for keeping a lap time.<br />After about a year, the battery quit which, I realize, may vary depending on shelf time, but other than that it is still with me. Now the band started wearing, and has since broken, but for the stress it received, I am impressed.<br />For the price, it is worth it to buy another watch and have a backup, instead of dealing with a new band.<br />Just ordered a new one myself., This has been my best watch.  Very accurate and comfortable to wear.  Size and weight not an issue,  Very legible day and night., I arrived item thank you, Difficult to connect to smart phone. It's ok, but what can be expected for $18.00? If anything fails, it's a cheap watch, My hand keeps hitting the buttons changing the fact. Irritating, the other model with small silver buttons did not have this problem. Otherwise good., The watch is solidly built, which from my experience is common with Seikos. The chapter ring lines up accurately. The dial is a slightly lighter shade of orange than the chapter ring, which is kind of annoying but I guess it's a trade off for being solar powered. The worst part of this watch is the position of the crown, which rubs on the top of my hand while being worn. Haven't gotten it wet and don't plan to, but I'm not concerned with the water resistance of this watch, as Seiko divers are usually top notch when it comes to that. Lume is great after being exposed to light and lasts a decent amount of time. The band it comes with is comfortable (for me, your experience may differ) and looks great in contrast to the dial. I don't like when the metal bracelets pull the hairs on my arm., The second hand broke off 2 months after purchase., It is really small, and the band is really thin and cheap, it is not what I expected as I purchased a similar one last year and the band was longer and more durable/sturdy. I do not recommend for anyone over the age of 10, I have a Stuhrling watch I purchased earlier and since I liked it so much I decided to buy one with another color band and face.  The band on this watch is a bit narrower and seems out of proportion with the watch face. It is a very nice looking watch and this may not bother some people., It's not made well broke the first time I wear it. But it is cute I will say that and it looks just like the pic., My wife loved it. It's the style she likes an fulfilled her spectations. She liked its light weight., Very nice watch, but if you are a larger than the catalog models, this won't fit your wrist. That's a bit sad as most people I'm acquainted with are larger than me. On the last hole of the band, it was still uncomfortable to wear., Looks better in person!!, Best automatic watch you can buy for the money. There's a reason this basic design has been around for so long - it's an excellent, durable, handsome watch., owned it 3 months already had to replace battery not happy., Really not a great product. The punches are too big to get watch links out. The link resizer isn't large enough for a 23mm band.so you have to take it out and use it as a punch anyways... Cheap tools. But 8 bucks and I was able to resize two of my watches., Fantastic! It looks even better than the picture. Arrived promptly and was safely packaged. It didn't come with a case, but that's understandable (less than $50 watch) I mean come on. Those who complain about not being able to set the date, it's not a big deal. Just wind the clock forward until the date changes. And this has to be done once a month. Small price to pay for such a great looking watch for such a low price. The band quality is superb. It is rigid at first, but once you work it and break it in (1-3 days), it becomes soft and takes the contour of your wrist flawlessly.<br /><br />In conclusion, the only gripe is the lack of a case, which is to be expected for the price. Band is sturdy, soft, and complements the red clock hands. The face is not too large and is intriguing because of the small magnifier for the date. I would recommend this watch to anyone who doesn't want an overly large watch yet one that draws attention while simultaneously being subtle., Really simple, classic, quality watch. Good size face and beautifully crafted. It's a bit flatter than expected but this is good. Most of the trendier watches worn today are fat and heavy. Really unnecessary really considering it's used to tell time rather than anchor a boat. I feel comfortable with a Seiko knowing their long tradition as solid watch makers., I have a small collection of watches, and this was a great addition.  I got this watch because it was a lightning deal, and it matched the school colors where I work.  It is a very nice looking watch.  The only thing I didn't care for was the pins for removing links.  I have a link remover tool, but it doesn't work with the pins in this watch.  I was able to size the watch myself, but it wasn't as easy as it would have been if it had standard pins in it., Very Disappointed.  This watch failed to pair with my Galaxy Note 2 and Galaxy Note 4 phone.  It would complete the pairing process and it would show identical pin numbers for pairing, but each attempt resulted in a message that the pin could not be confirmed.  I tried every variation I could find on the internet (there were a lot of issues and solutions listed there for pairing problems with the Moto 360).  I made my attempts in two different network environments (work and home) using two different phones.  Each phone completed all the pairing steps as designed and produced a pin that matched on each unit.  BUT THE FINAL MESSAGE ALWAYS STATED THESE IDENTICAL PINS DID NOT MATCH  I saw the number over 20 to 30 attempts and the pin numbers always matched and the message always failed to confirm the process.  I returned the unit to Amazon and did not request a replacement., Excellent quality. Easy on., Just as described. Installed by hand and held up to multiple attempts.  Contacted seller regarding previous purchase. Seller was courteous and prompt with refund. Pay attention to dimensions to avoid ordering the wrong size, Trust me,,, it's an eye catcher,,,,,, after one month, watch will not keep time, save your money 😤, Awesome, Nice cheap watch, that looks really good. Basically a generic low priced pocket watch with a quartz movement (uses batteries).<br /><br />The cover art is very good with a deeper than expected relief and very sharp detail.  The watch face is fairly plain with stylized Arabic numerals for hours and minutes/seconds. The hands are of a fine filigree. The back has a floral decoration.<br /><br />The Cyrillic writing translates as &#34;Saint Petersburg&#34;. The ship depicted is the Russian Cruiser &#34;AURORA&#34; a 1900 vintage  Pallada class Cruiser.  It is a historic ship that is currently on display in that city.<br /><br />The watch itself  works fine and can be found on a popular auction site for about half the total price paid here., very pretty looking watch! different than anything I have seen so far! I love it! you can't beat the price!, I love this watch!  I had to get about three links removed but other than that it looks and fits great.  The quality and look of this watch is exactly what I expected., this is the best in a series of 6 or so Casio watches and it's the best so far., OKAY, Great strap, BUT too short. I have to use the last hole and the remainder of the strap is too short to be tugged into the loop, Most of my watches are huge... over 67 millimeters ...you call them big face watches, and this case held them all. I couldn't  find a single thing wrong with is product. The red stiching on the pillow was amazing and perfectly done. The lock works...it's of great quality.  The seller shipped it fast and I would buy from them again. Very pleased., My daughter really likes this watch, and the coloration.  Thats really the main attraction here, because the watches functions are very common and basic.  Its true that you can use the stopwatch to &#34;train&#34; with but there is hardly a digital watch that doesn't.  So, when you are buying this item, I think you should mostly be looking to see if they hit the aesthetics right.  For my daughter, it is great.  She is very pleased with the color and it works well enough., you are such liars!!! my watch is fake...it doesnt have the michael kors stamp at the back.. liars!!!!, it does not work!, the watch is nice, but it being a unisex watch.. it is ENTIRELY too loose for any normal woman's wrist. there really is no reference to this in the description so they should probably just switch it to a Men's watch only. I am sending this back ASAP., It's a beautiful watch,  I love the stainless with the white ceramic.  The clasp is a little complicated to take off but other than that no complaints., Sent to me with a dead battery, have had this watch before, until I wore it out.  Glad to get another one, LIKE IT, This is a great watch for work.  It is comfortable,  I have a small wrist, it fits me fine.  I especially like the light, I can check my watch at night, I wear glasses and can see the dial fine without my glasses., Watch was mans size. Too big for lady. Returned it., it looked fine but it was not wide enough.  Contacted the seller to see if they had something wider and their response was to just say send it back., The item starts rusting the hence not rated well, Hate it! My wrists are small and its usually hard to find watches that fit without looking too bulky, but the watch is way too small. Don't buy it unless your giving it to a baby or a barbie., I bought this very affordable watch on the spur of the moment. Since then, I've received TONS of compliments on it from several different people, including strangers. What I love most about it is that you can go online to search for 20mm canvas watch bands and there are many, many color options your can order for like $5 each, that easily slide into this watch. The process could not be simpler, as there's no pin removal or tools required. I bought a black/red band, and a navy/red band to swap out from this blue/white one., COOL, Cheap material... Broke with a week.... No shipping info was given, so I had to check the mail daily hoping to finally get it for a few weeks.... Not made for men's size wrist... For woman or young adults ok, Screen is tremendously fragile for the price of this watch. I'd read some reviews on a watch by the same company about how easily the screen cracked, and hoped that it wouldn't be the case with this watch as well. Unfortunately no- it lasted about 4 days of regular wear, but when I took it off on the last day and set it down on my wooden dresser the screen cracked right down the center! Without any rough treatment at all. I am very disappointed with the quality of the watch considering how much it costs-the screen is far too thin and is an irresponsible of the seller. You could probably get something as cute at Target for $20 that would last years longer., I'm giving the watch 5 stars because the construction of it is very solid. It really seems to be a terrific watch all around for the price. But, unfortunately, I'll be returning it. My fault really, I should have taken the time to convert the centimeters to inches regarding the watch face. I relied on the images and it's larger than it looks in the those; truly a mans' size. Chuckle....I feel like I'm wearing a large print watch except I'm not old enough to need that!<br /><br />I like watches the same as I like eyeglasses....light and barely there. If the face had been smaller it would have worked for me., Box came open with no instructions., Very feminine watch. I love the faceted crystal and the color. Easy to tell the time.  Only problem was trying to figure out how to adjust it. I googled it and found how to do it on YouTube! I've seen this watch on another website and Amazon had a fantastic price!, Looks good. Lighter weight than my other Victorinox. The band was extremely long., I ordered a black one and what i recieved is gray. Am so disappointed, Wouldn't say that this is the poor man's rolex or anything.... but I do offer this analogy:<br />Crawfish is to lobster as Orient is to Tag Heuer. If you are anything like me then you would understand that crawfish(orient) is just as delicious and versatile at a fraction of the price of lobster(Tag) Don't like my analogy?... well then you must've been shaken as a baby. BUT believe me when I say you really can't go wrong with this watch. It's classy enough to dress up, it's casual enough to wear every day and water resistant to boot, Maybe for more tech-minded folks this watch would work for them.  However, my husband and I found the instructions confusing. (We both are university educated so it shouldn't have been so hard.) It might be a great product, we just couldn't figure out how to get it to work.  Finally my husband just tossed it in the trash bin because he got so frustrated by it., the product is too old, let me feel too disappointed,why not a new watch? it's too bad, Will not set to proper time. None of the features work. Wish I had skipped!, Good watch. Blue band on crown fell of one of the first few times I wore it., I wanted a basic and inexpensive watch and that's exactly what I got. The band of the watch was bent upon arrival., Complete garbage. The dials are just nonfunctional spinning hands. Not worth even the 4 bucks., Very Nice Watch. Even though it is an automatic  I find that I need to wind it occasionally. It is a terrific watch for the money., Nice watch for the money.  One issue I have is thin black hands on a black dial make it next to impossible to read the time unless you are in direct sun light., For the money can't go wrong., I loved the hardware on this strap (the matte black clasp is awesome) but the leather felt a little cheap and the strap was way too long. I ended up sending it back and getting another strap from StrapsCo., very good looking ,Swiss made and automatic movement watch, for  affordable price.Royal blue looks awesome., The watch design is magnificent but it came with a dead battery. This made me very disappointed with the purchase because it was a gift to my husband. If it wasn't for this problem, it would have gotten a higher rating., Band is tight/short for my wrist - I'll replace the band and keep the watch for my work!, Seems well built enough I have only had it for a day or two so I can't say much as far as durability, but note; it DID NOT come with new spring bars, and has a slight blueish tint to it... kind of a gun metal blue... if that is what you are looking for then perfect, I was looking for more of a GREY GREY... my watch face was blue so it works well for me., This watch is gorgeous. I gave it to my husband on our wedding day. It doesn't need a battery! The face is blue crystal and my favorite part is that you can see all the cogs and wheels working! It's got a nice, big face. A manly but pretty watch. I wish they made a girl one like it., My wife bought me this watch for our 20th anniversary and I absolutely love it.  I own many Invicta watches and I prefer the bigger ones and this bad boy is big!  You will feel this on your wrist. I am a big guy so this doesn't really have an effect on me but if you are of a smaller build then this watch will let you know that you are wearing it.  I will say that even though this is a bigger, heavier watch, the polyurethane band is &#34;softer&#34; and more flexible than most others I have seen and this makes the wear of this watch more comfortable., Beautiful watch. Haven't worn it yet because I have to adjust it to my wrist size but is a very good looking watch., I was surprised to find how much I love this watch. It's super simple, keeps time well, and it's a lot prettier in person than it is in the photos. This is my new go-to watch for casual wear. I'm not normally a fan of digital watch aesthetics, but the convenience has won me over. The time, date, and day are so easy to read at a glance. The illumination works well too. And thanks to the low price, I can wear it carefree. It barely costs more than a fresh battery for my other watches. I'm genuinely impressed., This watch is so pretty in person. I can't believe the price. Definitely doesn't look cheap at all! Love it., Beautiful product with great shipping. I'm absolutely in love with my new watch! Would definitely recommend as a gift for someone, My wife has been looking for a watch with an alarm and an illuminated display. Most of the &#34;sport&#34; watches are large and clunky, but not this Armitron. The watch body is considerably smaller than the typical sport watch and the teal band color is softer than it appears on my monitor - my wife likes it a lot.<br /><br />This watch packs a LOT of features, which also means that the controls are a bit complicated. There are four buttons which get pressed in various combinations. A detailed instruction leaflet is included, but if you're over 30 you may need a magnifying glass to read it. There were some features we really liked:<br /><br />- You can set a second time zone (though the day indicator doesn't show in the T2 mode.) You get to this mode by pressing the lower left button four times. What is really nice is that if you set one of the three (!) alarms, you can specify which time zone it is for!<br />- As I mentioned, there are three alarms - these can be daily or weekly (on a specified day). The alarm sound is rather faint - my wife likes this, but if you need a loud alarm, this watch is not for you. There is also an hourly chime you can set.<br />- The stopwatch/chronograph mode has a split feature and you can also set a countdown timer<br />- The illumination is gentle - it doesn't light the entire face - and fades out after three seconds<br /><br />The watch is waterproof to 100 meters (330 feet), as long as you don't press any buttons., The pouch is exactly what I was looking for - it perfectly fits an electronic banking token I use! It means I can have the token in my pocket or bag without worrying that I might be accidentally pressing buttons..., Guys, it is awesome. I like it :) best price for luxury watch. Thank u amazon :), Just what I was looking for!....nice size, great for everyday wear!  Band is easily adjustable, face is easy to read...very happy with my purchase, Fades, not adjustable, This product is crap, no useless pairings tearing from time to time with the iPhone money waste Casio really disappointing, Excellent & Classy, You may need to get the links adjusted to size, mine is too big for my wrist, Larger than I thought it would be.  But a nice looking time piece., Is execellet, Came in broken, looks fake also. I have to return back to china for almost $30 in order to get my refund. I don't recommend., My favorite G-Shock. The black on black on black look is killer, the watch decently small (unlike the other huge Men's G-Shocks), and it is very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time., It looks good but there are better WR 200m watches from similar value or less. I sold it., It's a sturdy reliable watch that I wear when running, jogging, or walking.  Can't mess with a good ol' Casio!, Very sturdy and comfortable at the same time, Beside the weight, I would recommend it.  I got a lot of nice feedback from my friends., I use it for the beach., Love this little time keeper. Had one before this one and I have always wanted to another after it unfortunatly broke. Can't beat the price., OKAY, Awesome. Shipped quickly, Very nice watch. I returned mine because I had actually ordered a different model (12011) and paid $70, but this is what came in the package. Seeing how this watch is about $40, I retuned it to get the watch I had originally ordered. Its a beautiful watch and a good size. Not too small, not too large. A clean classic look., Awesome watch. The weight is what makes it better. Be prepared to shorten the belt though., I ordered this watch for my Dads birthday and I this watch is amazing, I had my doubts but it's a wonderful watch., cool watch, good size, easy instructions, Best gift you can give to your wife 🌹, The watch does not keep time properly, once the pendulum stops moving the watch dosent work the buttons and knobs are really lose specially the one on the upper left that controls the numbers, the date month and day skip, the watch is big and very poorly built, I was expecting a well-built watch and I also read the majority of the comments thinking that it was going to be a good watch unfortunately when it arrived I was very disappointed. I rather have less features and a watch well-built than to have a watch that doesn’t work at all. YUP, Really nice, very high quality replacement band. Soft and very comfortable, stainless clasp is thick and also of very high quality for the money. The  22 mm band gives the watch a bit more beef to the design, doesn't slip or move on your wrist. Very Happy with the purchase. Replacing the band is super easy, you need a small precision screwdriver size 1.4 mm then unscrew and pull out the rest of the way. You can view how too on YouTube. Thanks, I am  not sure what some of the people are taking about with the negative feed back but I have a few $10k watches I got this unit and I have not had one hiccup with it. I am a Firefighter and I wear this watch everyday that I work and it always looks great and runs perfect., very satisfied., I purchased this for my dad, to replace one I had previously given him. It is very comfortable and easy to read, he loves it., Exactly as advertised, Face is a little smaller than I wanted, but it works. Good for yatching or some other semi-casual activity., I am an avid watch collector and have my share of complications, chronos, etc...  After taking a breather and surveying what I own, I decided I should add to my dress watch collection, something clean, classic and slim to wear with my suits.  And I found this one.  I thought I would be disappointed when this arrived because it is missing all the bells, whistles and buttons of the others.  Instead, it has become one of my favorites to wear.  Beautifully made, sleek and elegant.  Also has a 1950s aura to it.  I am now looking for more Zenith Elite Ultra Slims and I think you should too but not before I buy my next one., Great watch for the price! I agree with some of the other reviewers when they said that the watch is like a children's watch. I would say quality wise it pretty much is similar to a children's watch. And it seems to be small. However I still like it and wear it daily., The band is small ,it seems like it's more for a kid instead of a mans watch ,but it fit so I keep it ,I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it .this is the second or third Casio watch I have bought from amazon and they are great watches., love this watch.  bought it in 2010 on my honeymoon to use while diving and the watch worked great.  it has since gone on many dives with me and it rotates as my daily watch.  it is a gorgeous to look at. it keeps great time.  it automatically goes into water mode when it touches water (you don't have to remember to turn on the depth gauge).  I love this watch.  i have had it 5 years now and i am only now replacing the band due to wear and tear.  definitely recommend., Great watch, got it as a gift for my husband who was always breaking watch bands.  Rugged, kind of sexy, not too flashy, but still a bit of Harley charm., This is a beautiful watch. I love it except for the fact that the band is too long. Maybe I have exceptionally thin wrists, but I have it fastened on the last hole and I can still fit two fingers between the band and my wrist. There are 8 holes for making the band looser, which I can't believe very many women have wrists that big.I wish I could get a smaller band., The watch that was sent to me didn't work.  Also, it looks like it has been used.  What a waste of time!  Now I have to return it and I don't have a watch to use., This is very nice casual watch, the face is very heavy and strudy, easy to set time as well. The wrist band stitching is red and looks a bit less casual or just not as elegant as the watch. The face is super large as well., Very pleased with the watch.  It looks stylish, keeps excellent time and the light weight is a real bonus., Great watch for the price. Took a long time for delivery, but worth the wait. My friend liked it so much he asked me to order one for him too. He got his in 2 wks. He loves it!, I'm absolutely head over heels for this watch. It has a cute little box to be kept in and the watch looks really expensive. Haven't had time with it yet but its really lovely., Took forever to get it, absolutely beautiful watch. I bought this watch for my girlfriend as a birthday present and she loves it. Everything she was looking for from the rose gold to the roman numerals and the white leather band. A very fine quality watch., TIMEX Women's T2H492 Easy Reader. I like this watch a lot. My TIMEX watches have always done better than all my other brand-name watches., bought it for my son.  he likes the quality and look., I like my watch! Thank You!, Best watch for the price in my opinion. Very reliable movement., Great watch!  I wear it everyday. Don't get it if you have bad or blurry eyes as the details of the watch are very small.  Might want to look for something easier to read or something digital. But good for normal eyes., This is my second watch of this style!!! My other watch runs good but the band broke. My husband bought me another watch instead of a band because of price!!!, Awesome. Thank you.., Awesome looking watch, makes a fashion statement., Best watch value ever! Handsome and experienced all features advertised!<br />Can't  believe the price!, worked perfectly, exact replacement, This is a great choice for a metal G-Shock. It wears big, but the way the bracelet attaches to the lugs makes it fit much better than my G-Shock with the resin strap. One interesting feature of the metal bracelet is that the removable links are connected by spring bars rather than pins. I don't know whether that makes it easier or harder to size, but a couple of spring bars did hit the ceiling while I was sizing the band. The digital displays provide the right amount of extra information to the analog hands and make it more user-friendly than the analog-only choices. The solar charging works well, and the only feature this model is missing is the multi-band radio signal reception. I have to think it was originally designed to include multi-band since the pusher at 4 o'clock is labeled &#34;search,&#34; and there's absolutely no function on this watch where &#34;search&#34; would describe what that pusher accomplishes. The metal bezel makes it look a lot better than the rubber or resin bezels you're used to seeing on G-Shocks, and the face is nicely proportioned to the overall size of the watch, where it sometimes looks undersized on other models., Complete garbage!!!<br />The band literally broke before I could even get a chance to put it on, I returned as I have not liked this much., I wear this watch to work at a doctors office.  I receive compliments whenever I wear it., The watch itself has a clean nice look to it, however it felt very small on my wrist. I figured I'd give it a few days to see if it would grow on me, but while at work the hand movements about drove me insane. They are very loud if you work in a quiet environment. I couldn't take it anymore and returned it. I just feel there are other watches in same price range that are much nicer (and quieter), such as many of the Lucien Piccard watches. That's what I ended up going with instead and the quality feels far superior to this Timex (even though they make a lot of great watches)., I was super disappointed when I received this watch. I love batman and wanted an inexpensive digital watch to wear to work that was also kids sized because I have abnormally tiny wrists. I originally purchased one of these at burlington coat factory and returned it when I realized that the top button (the one that makes it flash) had fallen out. I then decided to buy it here on amazon because it was about $5 cheaper and it would be less likely to have missing parts. When I received it, the flashed worked and all buttons were there but the time display didn't work. I tried doing every combination of the different buttons that I could think of and the different combinations that were on the instructions but it still wouldn't work. I even opened up the back to try taking out the batteries and replace them but that didn't work either. Ended up getting a refund for my money. Amazon let me keep the watch even after refunding me, but now I have no idea what I'm going to do with a watch that doesn't display time and only flashes., Exactly as pictured and super cute.<br /><br />Might buy other colors :-), The watch band is flimsy, itchy plastic to stiff to wear comfortably. Even as a cheap watch, it's not worth the money., Outstanding service! Fits my watch perfectly and saves me from buying a new watch just because the band fell apart., Just as described. Very nice piece. My opinion is that it is both dressy and casual. And the face is big enough that I can read it without having to find my reading glasses!<br /><br />Update: I've had the watch for about 7 months now and this is my &#34;everyday&#34; watch. The face still looks perfect, but gold tone has worn off of a good portion of the band, especially the side that rests/rubs on my desk. Most of that side of the band looks silver now, with a portion of it being worn further and it looks to be copper underneath. I still love the style and am currently looking for something similar that will be more durable., too small for my wrist, too cheap to be worth the trouble of returning it, Be careful, I really needed a slightly smaller size.  I used a razor blade to cut a tiny piece off each side to make it fit.  Looks good., Very comparable to the Suunto core black, but wears much smaller with a better bracelet. The bracelet does use solid pins with a tiny insert in the center section of the link, so if you're not comfortable working with tiny pieces, you might want to have this sized by a professional. The bracelet is also much more narrow, particularly on the back side. While the photo shows the seconds counting around the outside of the dial, there is no ability to actually select that display on this watch (although the Suunto does have that as an option). The compass &#34;pointer&#34; moves around the outside of the display there, but not the seconds. Overall, there are fewer display options than the Suunto, but it mirrors all of the core functions. Two aspects that are superior to the Suunto are the sapphire crystal and the solar charging. If you're going to get an all-digital ProTrek, this is one to choose., Purchased this watch last month, I loved the way it looked, feminine and so delicate. This is a beautiful watch, and very made, the only thing is I have a small wrist and have to find someone to take off some links., Exceeded my expectations. Big face and lots of cool features., Simple. Has all the necessary functions. Cheap., the watch face/size is actually way too small for my taste; and for my eyes! I can hardly read what time it is... : (, Great watch horrible band. The band wouldn't latch out of the box. but it keeps good time and is nice looking., Fits my Pebble Watch perfect! High quality, will take time to break in... More later on., This watch is so nice!! You can use it while dressed casual or all dressed up. Every time I wear it I get lots of compliments. And the price? 10 stars!!, Not as quality as pic..but ok, Very chip, Very attractive and made well, Looks more expensive than it was, Longest pin was not long enough for need., I would have gave it a 6 star but the latch has issues.  The little squeeze latch doesn't work.  The final latch is all that's holding it on., armitron watches are very reliable and long lasting. Worth for the price paid, Adorable watch! recommend to all,, I time my most important medication with the count down feature. I time my walking with the stop watch feature. The alarm feature is very good. I like the imposing manly look.<br /><br />I had a similar watch for years. I rendered it useless trying to replace the battery., Awesome watch!!!, Very nice kit for the price point.  Works well.  Decent quality, This watch would be a good deal at twice the price. I would give it 8 stars if I could. I have dress watches I spent over $150 on that I don't like as much as this watch., Little to small for what I expected., Extra metal look and feel stupid., Stopped working about after a month, A bit stiff, but it will break in in time.  Perfect fit., The watch is great, except I ordered the purple one, not the light blue one that came.  Other than that, the watch is as described and seems to keep good time.  I figured it was more trouble to return it than keep a different color., Ok, original strap has low quality but watch is fair and accurate, Face scratches easily and it permanent., Really like it but wish it was a tad smaller, I absolutely love my new watch. I was looking for something casual that I was able to wear everyday.  My Fossil watch was it.  Thank you!  Susan, It is pretty but the white on the band keeps peeling off. I won't wear it because of that., Good looking, heavy, and too large for my wrist, but I really like this watch so I'll take to a repair shop to have some links removed.  It has more bells and  whistles than my Cartier Tank  and it's great for international travel as it has the times and dates of cities worldwide available at a glance.  No, it can't count calories nor steps taken,but I don't consider that  to be a minus because, it's quite easy to switch to a pedometer type device when you reach your destination.  All in all, a fine timepiece that does what a watch is supposed to do, tell time accurately., I never received it.. Glad it was cheap, Had the watch for about a week. Stopped working and band broke all in the same day!!!, My wife is very pleased with this watch.<br /><br />., Gets compliments almost every day I wear it. Very  attractive watch., Purchased as a gift and my son can't be happier. Arrived before the scheduled date looks good enough I'm gonna order the red one, Better then I expected., It looked olive green when I first wanted to order it and it was gray but it still looks very nice so we  kept the watch., Perfect thank you, Awesome watch. But its big. I'm 6' 3&#34; 220 lbs and its slightly heavy on my wrist but if you like bigger watches its a steal, Great ! Well done ! The watch is the best in amazon :) nice price !! Thank u amazon..., Excellent condition, perfect!, fatt risk, Very elegant, I got a f***ING coin holder., This watch is absolutely amazing, got it as a present and I am totally in love with it, very beautiful and elegant especially for small wrests like me. Will recommend for friends, Perfectly described, fast delivery, awesome price! 110% satisfied!, They got me on this one!!! My mottow has always been, you get what you pay for! This is crap!! Buttons don't work to set the damn thing, and it always scrolling something!! Into the trash it goes! Could have used that money to buy a beer!! Pissed off!!, Just what I wanted.  and exactly as described, I bought these because I wanted to have a nice set of watches but not drop serious coin on them. They're alright, the watch with days of the week on it the finish has started to rub off (after not much wear) and the stainless steel is somewhat noticeable and the other watch I really haven't worn because the chain is kind of clunky and moves around a lot. Honestly the box they came in was my favorite thing about this amazon item., quit working faster than expected. but like the bangle bracelet, Stopped working within 2 months and one of the ceramic links cracked. Is always 30 minutes off no matter how many times I adjust it. Within a day it's off again, Strap wore out in less than a year and isn't covered by warranty, This watch is simple, elegant, and has kept perfect time for me so far. I receive a lot of compliments on it., The watch has a good weight to it and the face size of about 44mm is big enough to be worn by people with wider wrists.<br />The face can seem to be a little busy, but I like the blue hands.  The clasp deployment has never opened when I was using it.<br />Day date and time has been running well and accurately.  I have my doubts on actually using this for swimming.<br />This is comparable to Invicta watches, who makes watches that takes inspiration from higher end watches.  The price of less than two hundred dollars is fair, anything over that I would think twice., VERY NICE WATCH.  KEEPS GOOD TIME.  I HAVE A SKIN ALLERGY AND ANY WATCH I WEAR BREAKS ME OUT AFTER A FEW DAYS.  I MM SURE THIS WATCH WILL TOO.  NO FAULT OF THE WATCH.  I LIKE IT AND WOULD RECCOMMEND IT TO ANYONE., Terrific old school watch, probably my favorite., Have had so many compliments., less than a week, the pin connecting the watch to the bracelet already broke., The watch is attractive and lightweight. The pictures are quite accurate. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 * is that I  the strap feels cheaply constructed. I've only worn the watch for two days so I don't know how it will hold up., Nice watch but face is larger than it appears in picture., My first bulova watch its is my favorite. Im a big guy and this watch looks good on me. Is has a elegant look., Stopped working after a month!, On third one ... love the design, but the product is defective or &#34;old&#34; dead battery stock is being sent instead of a truly &#34;new&#34; watch.<br /><br />Amazon credited a defective unit (thanks!) that literally fell apart (plastic housing separated from the body of the watch).<br />Backcountry refunded a &#34;new&#34; watch, 5 days after receipt, that had an issue with the back-light not working (dead battery?).<br />I'm using the 3rd one, but the back-light is so dim as to be unusable. Tired of sending these back so will keep it.<br /><br />Soleus, get your act together. Provide local dealers that can replace the batteries and seal., The watch looks great and has the quality that I have come to expect from Stuhrling. The instructions to set the day/date are a little general but you get the idea how to set the watch. The leather watch band is very heavy duty and should last a long time. I'm very pleased with the watch. It looks as good at home as it did online., l like..., After two uses it started to come apart!, Ok, First one lasted 3 weeks., Very confusing to set times and date!, COOL, Amazing watch! The gears and mechanisms look amazing, the crystal is tough, and tbe design is very flashy. But this watch does have one minor downfall which is its LOUD movements. It is a very loud watch and can hard to sleep to you have it on display in your room. If you can get past the loud ticking, then its a great watch!, Like the look of this watch - have had several earlier models of the G Force watch.<br /><br />Could not get the blue tooth synchro to work with my iPhone or Samsung phone.<br /><br />Would not buy this watch with my experience now., The Armitron Sport Women's Clear Jelly Strap Digital Watch is comfortable, attractive, and easy to set.  It has a stainless-steel back, an acrylic case, and displays the time in a large, bold font.  There are some features that could be a bit more user-friendly.  Although the day and date appear on the watch face, you can access the month only by pushing a button on the side.  This is not a big problem, since most of us know the month without glancing at our watches. What is strange is that the words Monday through Friday are printed in tiny letters, and the current day of the week is blacked out.<br /><br />Since I do not make a habit of exposing my watch to water, I cannot comment on its water-resistance. However, I would advise being gentle with the strap, since it is made of a resin-type plastic.  If you force the strap or make it too tight, the loop could conceivably break. I wear the Armitron a bit looser than necessary in order to reduce wear and tear.  The price is reasonable for this sporty and extremely lightweight timepiece that is practical for everyday use., This is my second time buying this watch, I got the first one in Europe and that lasted for years so I decided to buy a new one from amazon. After two months of careful usage today I saw there is steam in the watch, I didn't even go into the water, I just went to the beach where it is a little bit more humid than the city and this happened. I will be contacting the company for warranty.. I will be updating my review after talking to them.., favorite watch out of many, many., Love this watch!  It keeps perfect time and is just the right size for a man with a somewhat more slender wrist. Stylish and quality made., Great watch for the money. Made really nice and strap is perfect for my skinny wrist. still ticking after two days of not wearing it. I would recommend this watch to everyone out there., Love the new watch I got for Father's day.  Does not lose time at all.  Great style!, A gift, so not totally certain how it is being used or enjoyed, but seemed to be a hit on his birthday., 2 reviews and 5 stars? Seems legit., Very pretty, I needed an analog watch with a second hand that wasn't too flashy, or drew too much attention. I didn't want to spend a lot of money so that when it broke or became contaminated, it could be tossed without too much grief. After reading the reviews (some good, some terrible), I decided to give it a shot. The watch arrived on time well packaged and ticking. The chapter ring is perfectly lined up with the numbers. The dial is very readable, with large bright white numbers and day of week and day displayed.  The watch itself is fully plastic except for the backing which is stainless steel, so it is very light weight, as I often forget I am wearing it, and the band is very comfortable. The bezel, which does not have lumed numbers, rotates in both directions with a gliding motion, as opposed to clicking (which I prefer). While wearing it one day, I did noticed that the day of the week was stuck between days  (which is a majority of the complaints of the other reviews). I adjusted it with the crown (which does not screw down, just pushes and pulls in and out). So far is has not happened again since that day.The lume brightness and intensity of the lume is the weakest point of this watch. After being outdoors in a sunny day with it, the dial didn't light up at all. As a test (but mostly out of boredom) I shone an LED flashlight on it for 1 minute; the lume barely reached an acceptable level of brightness, and was dark again in less than 2 minutes. I have not gotten it wet as of yet, so I can not attest to the water resistance. Overall a decent watch for 16ish bucks., I loved the watch, the crown pulled straight out once i went to readjust the time and shortly after the watch quit because of water. i would prob buy again just try again, Nice watch, My daughter likes that it helps her tell time. I was a little unsure about the band being durable from the picture, but it is thicker than it looks. Good price, good value., Fitted this about a month ago, after the first strap gave up the ghost after 7 years of hard use. this should last just as long., Broke within a week! The light stopped working and time seemed to be off. It had a moisture bubble in it like water somehow got inside but I never wore it in the shower, tub, pool, rain... Could only have gotten in there from washing my hands... Lame sauce, does not fit correct, Title says black band, Specifications section says calfskin. It is black rubber/vinyl.  Watch itself is okay, so far., Watch is excellent--the band , not so much.  I used my old Casio band., Not happy with this watch.  I've owned several Timex watches and liked them.  The Indiglo light in this watch is too dim to read the watch.  The glow in  the dark feature only lasts a few minutes and the hands have holes in them so there's not enough phosphorescent material to read<br />This watch is pretty much useless in the dark., The background is a really pixelated picture...but you get what you pay for., beautiful watch, Very good quality for half the price of similar watches. I was apprehensive about purchasing this watch as the price was so low. Nice job Polo, I love this watch!, Nice watch for little money. Is not water proof though which is kind of a disappointment, Very nice bracelet, a perfect fit on my Seiko SKX007.  Easily adjusted, great quality., I bought this watch for my sister, the watch works perfect however it looks so cheap and I'm not sure how long it is going to last, probably a lot, probably not., Excellent, Really beautiful. Very happy with this purchase., This was a birthday gift for my boyfriend. He loves it!! He has few G-shocks already but none with the larger face so this was a great addition to his collection. The gray camo is very stylish., It works well a lot going on in the dial area., Wife loves that she can see the face to tell time.  Day/date too small for her to make out., I recently picked up this watch and the Navy Weekender Chrono. I really like them both - especially for the price. The outer bezel on this watch looks like a brushed chrome in the picture, it actually has a dark gray, almost black, look. The numbers and chronograph dials are cream colored, not a bad look, but don't get the idea that they are off-white. The one big drawback from this watch is the hands also being black with a thin line of cream - which feels lighter than the cream of the numbers. It sometimes is hard to tell what the time is if you only glance at the watch. I would change this either with some sort of white skeleton hands or arrows to make it easier to tell time. The other unusual thing is that the date numbers are in white, so with everything in a cream color it really can stick out. I am glad they chose to go with the dark background though, making it less noticeable.<br /><br />Also, the seconds hand for keeping time is in the dial above the 6, the seconds hand on the watch is for the chronograph function. That's a deal breaker for some people - not me - but be aware. I did change the band because I prefer a leather band, but the NATO was nice. It's on 20mm lugs, which is a nice size. The watch is overall is really nice, a great size for a chrono. It feels great, is good for those days when I feel like something different. The biggest thing is that this Weekender, and the navy, are a little thicker than the traditional Timex Weekender - but also DON'T have the audible ticking. That had turned me off to a lot of Timex watches - I haven't noticed with this one yet - even when listening for it., This watch is huge.  It's a little big for my taste, but I still enjoy wearing it.  I know Invicta makes larger watches, but I got it anyway.  It doesn't look ridiculous on my rather smallish wrist, but I had to take 7 links out I think to make it fit...haha I wanted a black watch, but not all black.  This watch was perfect.  The only thing I don't like about it is the redundant date.  It has a date window, and the bottom dial is the date as well.  I wish the bottom dial was for the hour on the timer function.  Other than that, its a great watch., Piece of crap. Stopped working after two months., l like..., I'm very disappointed concerning this watch it doesn't fit if your going to sell children's watches let the customer no, dissatisfied!, Sometime in the last 5 years they have degraded the quality of the watch.  With in the first week, the band fell off, the indigo duration is a fraction of what it used to be and after a brief period of use, the battery slowed and died.  Absolutely avoid this watch.  Granted it is cheap, but you will be frustrated with it, and ultimately spend additional money to replace it in short order.  Huge waste of money., I love this watch. I have small wrists, but it fits me fine.  I'm actually going back for another., Not as advertised, The watch died about 45 days after I got it. Could not return because of the 30 return policy.  I am deployed and was hoping for this watch to last longer. I did like the looks and feel., 1000 TIMES SMALLER THAN HOW IT SEEMS TO BE, Worked perfectly!  Not exactly easy to install it on my old watch, but easier than I expected from reading the reviews, and way cheaper than a new watch.  Great deal for less than $9., Excellent Wacth!!!, This watch is not bad overall, and the price is right. But as some reviewers have said, getting the band to loosen up for adjustment is a real challenge. I followed the advice of other reviewers to read the documentation on it, and the closure was still so tight that popping it loose causes bending of the parts.<br /><br />If this thing had come with a regular leather band, I would have been fine with it. Now it doesn't want to stay clasped and tight, so I've given up and put in on the shelf., Watch functions great, but wrist band was too small. the wrist band should be larger., My wife loves this watch. Just the right amount of bling. Water resistant not waterproof., Was a great watch, but returned because it was for a really larg man and could not shrink to my size., CHEAPLY MADE, BROKE WITHIN 2 MONTHS, Great looking watch but my band got weird white stains on it right after I received it. Seems like cheap quality leather/ knock off material. I'm going to have to buy another band. The face looks great, but it is a little difficult to read the time, Excellent Wacth!!!, I had to return this watch, it was too big for my wrist. Pay attention to it's 48mm size, 24mm band. It was huge. I really liked the face, it's a great looking chrono it's just very large. Had it not been as big, like my other Pulsar Chrono, I would have kept it., The only issue with this is the band, and there isn't any other type of band available for this watch. It is somewhat difficult to read as well., Fast delivery,like the watch, Cool for the price, Battery  was dead when i received  it. So it was NOT a deal, I received this watch, it does not work, contact the seller, he gave somethings to do even replacing the battery(in a brand new watch), I took it to a jeweler who told me the battery was more than the watch cost, very disappointed, very nice watch--can read it easily and the glo part works well at night---wish there was one like it that had military time, It is not a high quality product. Don't go by the HD pictures posted here. I bought it and returned it in less than 10 hours! The rear casing is like that of a 20$ China watch. Even the strap is rough kinda rough and is irritating when you wear it tight., i own many Invicta watches, this blue faced is beautiful!! Keeps time pretty accurate, for having the watch a little under 3 years...i have had my Rolex for 15 years, and it skips on time...a bit slow...on the seconds...but still a trooper!!! anyhow, the Invicta is definitely giving my Submariner a run for the $$$,, i bought this Invicta, because I love to take care and have all my really nicer watches show no sign of wear...Invicta....great Company, great products, great  Service!!, Nice simple watch nothing fancy I bought it for a work watch the price was good an I can read the numbers setting the time can be tricky so read the instructions carefully other than that I am satisfied, It is a very handsome watch and I like it very much but with a couple major complaints.  The numerals on the day display are VERY small and hard to see and the moving red dot that denotes the day of the week is also Very small and hard to see and not nearly as dramatic as it is in the picture display and was one of the main reasons I bought the watch.  The other reason is that Amazons price was lower by about $20 than any other place I found it for sale taking into account that it was a Amazon &#34;deal of the day&#34; item.  Overall, happy with the purchase., Very poor quality. But, it was very inexpensive, hard to see the Dials and buttons.. light is minimal and the WHITE fades quick and leaves black marks where it fades.. SUCKS cause i love the look of the watch .............so i still wear it LOL till the next one :), the watch arrived with one diamond missing. but sending it back was too much of a hassle, so i decided to keep them., I own several high end watches that cost several thousands of dollars and decided to take a chance on this Invicta.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This is a high quality good looking watch.  Chronograph works great and even counts 10th's of seconds for the first 30 seconds.  It is very comfortable to wear and the band is sturdy.  This watch comes off as high a quality level as my Monte Blanc's  and Tissot's of similar design.  the online photos do not do it justice.  It came in a high end case and had plastic film covering the crystal and metal case surfaces.  Even the metal inserts on the band were wrapped in plastic.  Will definitely buy Invicta again over much more expensive brands.  Incredible value and quality for the price!!!!, Beautiful watch. I will look to see if it comes in other colors. Recommend watch for both men & women, not too big, not too small., SO COOL, It does not look anything like the picture., Came 2-3 weeks early, nothing broken, same thing as retailed, not more to ask for, cheap bands, Works well., Good item ! Looks very nice !! Fast ship !!  Thank you, Item arrived and was scratched in numerous places.  It did not appear to be brand new and looks as if it had been used., Perfect for the price, Looks just like the picture and I adore the band. Size is perfect, Much bigger in size than I expected. (SEE PICTURE!!!)<br /><br />I feel like I need to wear a fat gold chain with giant emblems on it to wear this watch. The face is flat, and the glass (also flat) is so far from the face that I feel like a tiny metal ball should in there so I can try to roll it into the hole. If I was walking through the desert I would store my last 40 drops of water in the face of this watch., This is a very quiet clock and the black face with white hands and numbers makes it easy to see in the middle of the night., It reminds me of Gardner to remind me of were I've been, were am I now and were will I be... :), I ´m happy with this purchase!!! BEAUTIFUL WATCH!!!, Got this as a gift for my wife. Solidly built with comfortable leather strap. The 24 hour clock does take some getting used to but she loves it! A win for both of us., I'm a busy college student and this is the perfect watch. It's smaller than I perceived in the picture, however, I'm not disappointed. It matches everything that I wear which makes it the perfect watch for someone not interested in having an extensive selection to decide from in the morning. Also, I can finally tell someone what the date is when they ask with this handy, little watch's date keeper!, Really cool watch with a lot of cool functions, only complaint is that the digital is hard to see in low light environments, other than that I'm pretty satisfied., Beautiful, not too big. not too small. has chronometer, alarms, light, waterproof and I found it at a good price. It was delivered on time also. Big,clear display., Like watch.  Easy to read face, but loose around wrist., The watch is quite lovely and very much resembles the picture.  Unfortunately, it is a little  big, even after removing the extra links; I have small wrists.  Despite the size issue, I still wear and enjoy the watch., This is a beautiful watch... Very classy and elegant. There are multiple links that you can remove to adjust the size. I'm happy I purchased it!, Excelent, Have had one for the last six years and the band finally gave way., The watch has never run since I got it.  I will return it., Very convenient features, easy to press buttons, bright night-time illumination. However I haven't yet asked the question about statement not to press buttons under water. Does that mean also when wet?, as discribed., while not as well made as my previous band, it does the trick. Easy to install, I've had many Timex Ironman watches, all very functional. This one is a bit &#34;dressier&#34;--narrower strap, classier face (diamond shaped), lighter than usual color. It's somewhere between a work-a-day watch and a dress-up watch. It definitely has a place in my wardrobe. The only thing I wish I had known before I purchased it is that parts of the face have a shiny chrome-like finish--unexpected, but I'm getting used to it., UNBELIEVABLE VALUE FOR THE WATCH., Robust waterproof watch with a sporty appearance., Love the retro look, small size, and solar power, but I wish the band weren't as stiff - will take some time to break in.<br /><br />Note: I have small wrists and this fits perfect! Larger wrists might want to reconsider., just what I needed to attach my new band, I have nothing but accolades for this watch. Subtle and attractive., The numbers do not glow in the dark., This band is a good quality, but is not extra long as advertised. It is the same length as the standard bands., Amazing quality and so light.  Forget I have it on at times.  All my friends want to know about it.  Great buy !!, Beautiful bracelet , fast shipping . Will def order again, I gave this product max stars because of its WOW factor. It's fun to watch when you push the TIME button and different color lights start flashing to give you the time most people can't figure out in the beginning. I liked the watch so much I bought two additional spares. Price was so low replacing the battery will probably be more costly. By the way, the watch works great., Very attractive and elegant, Perfect!! Area trend make feel really important 5 stars! Quick delivery, Fits perfectly and exactly as expected the shipping took a little while but it worth waiting so unique and vintage looking watch<br />Definitely recommend it ., Dears,<br />How it is possible to repair when that time i use the second &#34; hand&#34; not working properly , everytime not moving but the time is working .<br />Please help what is possible solution .<br /><br />Thanks & best Regards<br />Rommel, Beautiful watch.  Excellent graduation gift., Thin face ..hard strap leather.. Deficult to read, I purchased this watch as a gift for my nephew.  It has a fun contemporary look and was definitely a good choice, I had to return this, poor quality., Thank, bought it as a present for my wife - people just go &#34;Wow&#34; !!, Great quality Invicta watch that is an awesome edition to my collection of watches. I love the big magnifying face of it which makes it easy to read the time, day of week, and date at a quick glance. The versatility of the leather watch straps is also a plus to better coordinate with various wardrobe styles. I am very doubtful that I will ever use the blue watch band that is just my personal preference. I have no regrets purchasing this fine time piece., Looks beautiful keeps steady timer so far, My boyfriend loved this gift for his birthday and it came in a Armani Exchange box with a little book for instructions and just more proof that it is the real thing. The only thing I had a problem with was that when I first opened it to check there was scratches on the plastic cover holding the watch and I guessed it was from the watch, didn't really see any damages to the watch so I decided to it was okay. It was a bit big for my bf so we had to resize the link so if you're unsure of the size you should buy something small like that minuscule screwdriver that is used to fix glasses to fit inside the holes of the links., It's an okay watch for fashion, Excellent Wacth!!!, Excellent wacth!!!, I read a lot of reviews for this and thought it would be a breeze to use. I read that some people suggested to inflate the ball and it was a cinch to get the watch back off. I tried it both as it came and inflated and I cannot get the back off of my husbands watch. He has a Tommy Bahama watch that he researched for how to get the back off and it seemed easy enough. However, we have not been able to get the back of his watch off. It's a fun ball for my toddler to run after now., Trying to find out where origin of brand is from. I like the watch verymuch., Beautiful watch. Couldn't be happier with my purchase., The best piece of item ever bought on amazon. This watch is so beautiful and look so gorgeous, if there was a 10 star I would give it 11star, An excellent quality watch coupled with a competitive price. It is a no brainer if you are in the market!, unique and quality product, Not exactly what I wanted but it'll do., Nice watch got several compliments, This is a great toy. The ABC readings are not super accurate but they are certanly fun.<br /><br />When on a hike, I'd suggest to re-calibrate the altimeter (very easy to do) at the trailhead and then every time you see an altitude marker. That way you can actually have pretty good measurements.<br /><br />In regards to temperature do not expect to have good readings from your wrist. Take the watch off and wait for a few minutes.<br /><br />I like that the face turns off at night to save power and I love that it receives the radio signal every night to keep up with the atomic timekeeping.<br /><br />In short, this is not a professional tool and by any means gives you precise measurements. If you plan to climb Mt. Annapurna and rely on its readings then you should look somewhere else. But it's super fun and it surely satisfies all your Junior Woodchucks needs., Number 4 is wrong., This watch is WONDERFUL and holds upwell. I recommend it for anyone who wants their children to become confident in being able to tell time. In our house it was becoming a struggle to get our 9 year old to tell time so we got her this and all of the sudden she can look at a clock and figure it out! This watch played a huge part in that and gave her confidence., Great watch so far, I have been wearing Timex Expedition watches for 15 years. Always been a good watch, not so big watch still working fine now, I arrived item thank you, After reading the book does more than what I needed hahahaha!, Seems useful but the pins are bent., The wrist band broke right when my son put it on. We had to return it which was super easy., 7 year old grandson really feels cool with this watch.  it has survived many a pool swim and dive at 3 feet.<br />fits his wrist and like all kids figured out the modes pretty quickly.<br />I really like this Timex watch and more importantly he does too, Watch is large but reasonably light.  It is well worth the size.  Display is bright and easy to read.  Setting it to my time zone was easy.  The only real negative is the tiny sized but thick instruction manual evidently designed for very small readers.  A larger manual with fewer pages would be much easier to hold and read.  I bought this watch to replace the previous model, which broke its strap after five years.  The old watch itself still operates well.  It has been a real treat not to have to replace dry cells at any time; the solar charger operates just fine., It took a while tell it gets here but Nice looking cute watch and thank God I have small arm rest cause it's soo small if you have a bit wide pons arm rest don't purchase it ., Adjustment screw heads missing the groove to turn them out., Thank you !, I wanted a low-profile watch for travel where pulling a phone out to check the time is inconvenient.  I have a small wrist so needed a small watch that was still readable.  Not so easy to find.  This one is perfect.  It is small but very readable - even the date.  It has two time zones - great for travelers.  And it has a light which actually lights the numerals so you can read them. Things to know:  The watch doesn't lie flat which means that the true width of the watch is all the silver that you see - that stretches completely across my wrist.  The band is a little stiff and a little longer than I would like but it is okay.  Most importantly, the directions have an error.  The buttons are not labeled correctly in the graphic.  They are actually ABCD, working counter clockwise.  I discovered this when I went online to print out a bigger version and saw that they had been re-marked. It is easy to operate once you are using the right buttons!, Oh My God!! Quality is unbelievable, comes with a very nice box. Perfect for gift. It looks like a $500 watch!!!, Watch is very good looking. Easy to set. Hands are very easy to see. Lightweight and water resistant. The strap is plenty<br />long even for one like me with pretty thick wrists. The hands are the only thing illuminated at night. Not super bright, but<br />can be read. Would absolutely recommend., OKAY, The band was a little tight,but I think it will stretch in time,& I have a small wrist, Received my beautiful watch a few hours a go!!!! Love it already!!!<br />It defiantly  is a beautiful watch but at first look I was doubtful if it was a legit guess watch!!!!<br />But after checking everything it looks good to me!!!<br />Though as mentioned in the description it didn't come in a GUESS GIFT BOX it rather came in a GUESS ZIP LOCK pouch!!!!!<br />Also the key was pushed in which means the watch was already working doubt for how long it's been working and for how long the battery will survive ¿¿<br />Also there was no protection seal or the transparent wrap on the glass or the strap at all.... But neither did I see any scratches or any other usage or damage signs!!!!<br />So far so good just been a few hours!!! Will surely update with time!!!!<br />Also I have attached the pics... The tag says 115$ but I got mine for about 80$!!<br />Thanx., Elegant, receive lots of compliments., I have no idea why i am the first review to show up here. Something seems super sketchy! These watches &#34;look&#34; fine, but are terrible quality!, I was in love with the watch from the very start. It had a great feel and weight on my wrist and was a very good looking watch. The dial turned easily and I used it daily for timekeeping at work and home. It says that the watch is waterproof down to 200M, which is pretty incredible for any watch, but my experience has not shown this capability. After the first time I went swimming with the watch on, no deeper than a few meters at most, the watch took in water and has had droplets on the inside of the glass ever since that does not go away. I have tried to file a complaint via amazon but with no luck. Also, the dial does not turn at all anymore., I already use it to adjust one of my new watch. It works! The price is cheap for what it can do rather than paying more to just adjust your bracelet,, Love it; looks good, keeps accurate time,I  use the chronometer to time my track team runners, fits my large wrist, people think its a $200.00 watch!!!, I used this a few times for taking timed tests and it served me well.<br />I like my watches face downward on my wrist and even after mashing the clock face on a desk, it was still intact with few very minor scratches.<br /><br />I don't use watches too often but after a month or two I found the watch and it wasn't telling the correct time anymore.<br />you need to wind it up every now and then., Just what I wanted in a watch., love this watch - simple, and stylish, The leather band is very soft and flexible., I am wearing it as I type this review on my Citizen Ecozilla. The rubber strap was too stif, I had to stop wearing the watch after a day or so. With this nato strap I can go week or untill I get bored., This watch is incredible. Looks and works flawlessly. Highly recommended. It's a bit priceybut iit's worth it. Great build and sturdy. Solar and radio timekeeping work very well. It's a bit heavy but very comfortable to wear. I wear<br />this watch all day with no discomfort. There are other G-Shock s at a lower price that are also excellent but you do get what you pay for. This watch is premium and truly the master of<br />G-Shocks. I own three other G-Shock watches but this is my favorite go to watch., For a watch with bad threads on the caseback it works, Color fades away turns brown after one week waist if my money never agian purchase any item like this !!!!!!!, Crystal stones were missing out of bracelet, Good watch for the price, a lot of function that I will probably never use. The display is pretty good and I can see it in sun light; at night I have to push a button to light it up. I wish this kept the watch lit longer but its OK. I would buy again., I like it., Fantastic product! No battery needed just twist and go. Looks a lot better in person!, So far I give it 5 stars. I have only had it a few weeks. Will see what happens after being outside and swimming., Cool, THe watch stops working after few hours. The hands stop working if left ideal for some time. I don't know if there is some problem with the watch or if it batteries need changing. Please provide some solution as it doesn't look good and feasible to reset the time all the time when this happens to be a new watch. Just dissatisfied with this product., Extremely good looking watch.  Haven't taken it off since it arrived.  Many compliments from friends., Nice watch, good price. But there was one missing stone on the face watch, I had the same problem with the other watch I ordered last time. Missing stone on the face. I returned it and bought this watch and here we go again I have had the exactly same problem. I think Amazon should take a closer look on how they should handle these delicate things and make sure there is not any defects on them prior shipping out to customers. It is my second time I have to ship it back to get another one. Disappointed...!!!, It's beautiful, just as the picture<br />I will definitely order more<br />Five stars all the way<br />Thanks Amazon, This device is awesome.  My wife purchased a nice watch and it was too big.  This device was easy to use and does a great job!, This is a stunning watch. It's so unusual and quite beautiful.  I bought it for a gift and the person loved it but it was too heavy to actually wear for a woman. Now for a guy it might be better fitting but not for a woman. However the watch is FABULOUS!!, OKAY, This is a really nice inexpensive and attractive watch. It does just about everything you could want a watch to do. Complete date, month, day, year, day of the week. Stop watch. Lighted dial on demand. Water resistant.  These plastic watches are hearty which I like, especially for teens, or younger kids. The face of the dial is flush with the watch body so the crystal should last. Overall, I think this is a great watch, well-priced watch for an active busy woman into sports, and outdoor activities. It is made well and should hold up under a lot of activity., This watch has different prices!!, Pretty watch...but stopped working after a few weeks, not sure yet they stopped runing hopeing its just the battery, Excellent and beautiful, Perfect!, everything is perfect, I like the watch itself but not the wrist strap, it just isn't very appealing., A nice looking watch to be sure.  It is a bit larger than I expected, but it looks great on my wrist., Very cheap and fragile., It was a mistake in my address. Fianlly I got the beautiful watch. The best seller with the best product! Thank you very much! I will recommend to my friends!, Had a few problems with communication at first, but his is a great company and they made things right. Thank you I will buy this with any products in the future. Money well spent., I like the watch a hole lot thanks Amazon, I had two (returned one for replacement and then had to return the replacement) of these that I ended up having to return because they both quit within a week and a half of having. They would just stop counting steps completely and by the end of the day would say I basically hadn't moved. I had a lot of hope for this helping me out, but sadly they ended up failing me., My girlfriend got me this watch as a gift and it was listed at $74 when she got it in April of 2015. The watch looks great and the band is comfortable meaning it doesn't rip your arm hair out by the roots or anything and it is easy enough to remove and add links, it's actually slightly nicer than most bands I've had. The watch face is also fairly easy to read making this watch more than just a bunch of gears to stare at. Now onto the bad parts. The watch runs slightly fast if you live a semi active life, meaning you excercise weekly or ride your bike to work etc.. but this is a very minor problem and the time only needs set about once every two weeks if you want it to stay less than a few minutes off. The spring, when fully wound, will last around 36 to 48 hours from what I have been able to tell.<br />Now I will tell of my customer service experience. After about 2 to 3 months I noticed my hour hand was about 20 min off for example, when it was 11:40, the hour hand would be directly over the 12 so it would make it look like it was 12:40. I sent it in. The process seemed standard, meaning you fill out a form and pay for return shipping which is $15. Then you write down an address if you happen to catch it before you press submit. Shipping both ways costed more than $30 which is unacceptable when I could take it to a watch repair shop, if there was one in my town, for less that. Additionally, it has taken them weeks to fix what seems like a simple problem. I have since bought a second watch (Casio Solar Powered) to use in the meantime because of how incredibly long they are taking. The company didn't seem to care about the customer from what I gathered. The bottom line is that this watch will probably break eventually and when it does, you will be faced with same decision I was faced with which is to pay a lot of money or wear a broken watch and no customer should be forced to make this decision simply because of the cost of claiming the warranty. I would not recommend this to a friend and I will certainly not be getting another watch from this company ever again. If someone gifted me another Kenneth Cole watch I would have them return it immediately. I hope this review helps in your purchasing decision., Very  Cheap material. The wrist band was made from really thin plastic, My kid broke in in the second day. Don't recommend this. Timex is much better quality, Bought this last week. Beautiful clock, but makes a slight ticking noise. So does their [[ASIN:B004XK1L7Y Braun BNC002BKBK Classic Analog Quartz Alarm Clock]] that we tried the week before. The Braun digital clock is quiet, so are using that one [[ASIN:B006J0WT4K Braun BNC008BK LCD Quartz Alarm Clock]] - but be aware, the digital clock is very small., I have had this g shock for about 3 months and I really like it because of the cool color and the analog and digital clock but there are a couple things that I would definitely change. The backlight does not illuminate the numbers up nearly enough. I was running at night and I couldn't see the time. Also, when the minute hand is around 40 it blocks the digital clock which can get annoying. So its a nice looking watch but there is room for improvement., It's a very nice looking watch, but it is hard to see if light shines on it wrong.  Should have a solid white back ground to be an easy reader., Nice Product, good looking.  The only drawback:  If you have a very small wrist it only allows the removal of the double link and two links from each side, so it will tend to fit very loosely, SO fresh and clean, Usually runs a few minutes behind at the end of the week. If you don't wear it for a day you'll have to reset it. Has lasted at least a year now with wear and tear. Goes everywhere with me except the shower. But it is water proof., Very uncomfortable to wear. The band is very stiff., A wonderful watch, let see how it performance, The key to this watch is the band and the clasp (one hand operation).  Otherwise it's a typical digital watch and the price is right., Didn't make it through the day, definitely not worth the very long wait.., bad, I bought the watch July 22 since it's arrival I have really enjoyed wearing it. The watch looks very well made but all of a sudden there has been some moisture under the crystal that seems to not want to go away after a week. I have not been in the water or any area that I would have come in contact. Not sure what will be done about it since I haven't been able to talk to any one yet about replacing or repairing it, It's hard to get customer service on the phone., It's a good watch have a lot of luxury and the box is beautiful!, Excellent!!!, I really like it, cute., I like the overall size of the watch but found that it was too thick and heavy for me. I have a small wrist so it didn't look right. Overall I like the look of the watch but didn't love it due to the thickness and weight., I like the blue shades, It was what I expected !, It broke after only 3 months., Bands broke off this after a month., Just got the watch but first impression is that it seems quality built. Very stylish and the silicone band feels nice., A real Good looking Im Sure machine will last forever, I was looking for a nice looking watch that was solar and also water proof. This one fit the bill perfectly.  I did a lot of research and this was the best one.  It is very nice looking, a bit heavier than my old watch but very striking.  I wanted a solar watch as my very expensive old watch was ruined when the back was damaged when I had the battery replaced.  Living in Hawaii you never know when you are going to get caught out in a rain storm so I needed my watch to be water proof also.  The catch on the band is much harder to accidentally pop open than the older Seiko watch that I had given to my daughter (it is still running after 20 years).  I would recommend this watch to anyone., Cheap, accurate, dependable watch.  The band finally gave out after 5 years and it was cheaper to buy a new one than get a new band., you get  what you pay for.<br />quality poor<br />stop watch function does not work, Beautiful watch, but look to big on the hand (a matter of taste ofcourse) and to expensive, It does the job. I couldn't get the supplied pins to fit my watch... they seemed too long. But the old pins fit, so it worked out., I needed a replacement Seiko dive strap as the original was beginning to show signs of cracking and fatigue. This Seiko strap is just like the original and fits the watch lugs perfectly. I did change out the strap buckle and replaced it with the original (as mentioned by other reviewers) as I like my original satin finished buckle rather than polished. I now have a spare just in case. The watch strap was also supplied with a new set of Seiko 22 mm X 2.5 mm spring bars, a nice added touch., I love the look of this watch but it does not work well...runs about 15-20 minutes slow. Bummer, Item was delivered July 18, 2015 & now the time is always delayed. It works on and off, The 4 on the face of this watch fell off and is floating around inside. Poor quality., My third one in 15 year.  I like the size of the numbers and it really has more functions than I use.  Just the right size as well, It's not even worth the money they charge has to be reset every other day or so and I think the cheap metal in the band might be giving me a rash?, i like it., Size doesn't mean performance. Although the details saying &#34;Not water resistant,&#34; I washed dishes and flooded the watch an hour after putting it on.  I didn't read the specific detail, I was looking for the big dial. No watch is worth babysitting each time I'm near water., Beautiful watch.  My husband loved it, easy to read, water proof. can wear all day and even into the pool., This is a nice little strap for the price. I was given a promotional discount to try this out, but I'd have been fine paying full price for it. I don't feel there's anything that sets it apart really, but if the price is right then I'd definitely recommend picking one up!, It is everything I expected.., It's a cool watch, stop working within a few months of use, it wont charge and made phone calls by itself, screen locks and im unable to use it ., Picture of watch is a little misleading.  Band is not completely brushed steel (middle links are polished), which is not what I expected.  Other than that, it's a good-looking piece, for the price., It's a great looking watch, but I had to return it, as the band was too large, and no way that I could see to make it smaller.<br />There is also no way to contact the seller to find out if the band could be made smaller.<br />ALSO, where the day of the week shows, it appears to be in SPANISH, not English. Why wasn't that in the description?, This strap also fits 5600J. Very hard to put on. I used a eye glass screwdriver to put new strap on. I cut the old strap off with a knife. It also helped to have a second person help. Would have gave 5 star but no new pins came with the strap., The watches are good but don't come in a box, The watch arrived on time. It looks nice.i hope it'll  work well and right., was fine while it lasted, had high hopes for this watch and am usually pretty good on what I buy. Granted it wasn't expensive but the watchband fell off the watch within two months. Don't buy, find better quality for a bit more expensive., My son wears this watch occasionally he hasn't complained yet about the quality.  It must be good!  I Used this back to replace a metal one he needed links for., This thing has 3-4 settings. I Can't recall. But it's 10 minutes on and 20 minutes off. 1 hour on and 2 hours off. What kind of winder is this? I need it to be wound 24/7. That's how the watch gets wound. I don't have a cheap watch by all means. It's a Tissot. But I put it in this thing and it dies. Whoever designed it should have their heads examined. I am glad Amazon took it back., Power cord &#34;conked&#34; out after 1 month. Been unable to use until we buy another power cord., Present for young girl..she us happy with it, Really bad product! It arrived late - very late - directly from China, and it wasn't keeping time after 3 days., This strap isn't much longer than average/normal straps I have used.  Needs to be 1 1/2 to 2 inches longer.  The big guy has NO WHERE TO GO to purchase good watch straps.  There has got to be a market out there.  Otherwise quality is ok., This item is an easy install and the watch is so much easier and faster to put on. Good quality and here in 2 days.. Gotta love &#34;Prime&#34;.. Here is a little video on how to install and use the Clasp in the title line.. HTTPS://YouTu.be/m6-8aJnyzrc, Perfect !!, Is it worth $60?  Probably/maybe.  Should it be confused with anything other than a lightweight, semi-inferior watch?  No.  Suitable for my 14 year-old son?  Absolutely.  The band is low quality (links, pins, etc) - that typically says it all for me.  Huge durability questions., All three children I bought these for were really impressed with them, after two weeks the setting crown cracked off in regular circumstances.<br />the watch is fairly comfortable and the watch face is nice.<br />the dials are a little confusing but it isn't so important anyway., The quality was worth the price however the face was not perfect and had headed marks around a dial., This set is really cute and fashionable.  I bought it as a birthday present and I think the young lady (turning 16) who will receive it will be very pleased., Super cool...appears heavy...but light on the hand....great design., I really wanted this watch but I'm broke. So I went and got a very painful surgery to get my kidney removed, cause I couldn't afford the numbing stuff. I then sold it and got bank. I then ordered this watch as quick as I could. But before I could get it, someone stole it. Just my luck. So that is why I'm giving this 4 stars, but I imagine that this watch is great, and all I got to show for it is a scar where my kidney used to be., Awesome watch. Unlike so many other watches today, the face size is normal, not HUGE. I'd say medium so it's proportional on an average man's wrist. It's also light. My favorite feature is the face. Bright orange with bright white fat hands make it super easy to read. And the night light feature lights up the entire face, not just a tiny digital display, which is quite the norm on other inexpensive watches. Ses to be high quality so I hope it lasts until at least the battery dies. Awesome watch, great price!, I love it! I wear it mostly everyday to work. The only thing wrong with it is that the knob on the side turned black that is a bit disappointing., Good watch for everyday use, it works well and doesn't look cheap., It came in just a couple days, easy to set, and looks good.  Accuracy perfect so far (little over a week) and self winding works super , you can even see self wind thru back glass window.  I just gotta figure out how to remove a link from the bracelet , the pins are screwed in but hard to loosen., Had to change battery when I received it. Functions erratically but I still like the look., Good so far. Setting the date is a little wonky, but that could just be operator error., OKAY, Beautiful watch! I love it! I'm not an expert on watches but this one looks pretty damn good; sophisticated and expensive. I have a tiny wrist it looks amazing after I adjusted the band., Works well.  I like it for my small wrist., It's still new so I'm getting used to it.  If it lives up to other Timex Watches I've owned it will be fine., much nicer than I expected!, Bigger frame glasses dont sit well on the little shelfs., Great watch, the face is fantastic, really clear and easy to read, the little dials not so much, The watch is awesome. It keeps great time and it looks nice. I can have my Buckeye's watch and it goes with just about anything I wear. Highly recommend purchasing this., Quality of watch exceeds price paid. Excellent purchase., Awesome watch!, I love this watch! The retail price according to the website is $115, which I think is a bit steep, but this item is definitely made with high quality materials. I think the red, white, and blue pattern is very patriotic but also eye-appealing. I love the ebony wood grain surface. I purposely got this for my boyfriend, who knows a lot about different woods, and he had said ebony wood is not really imported much into the US anymore and is very high quality, so I decided to get this for him as a surprise. The watch itself works very well, and the band is a little more stiff than I would have liked but I imagine it will loosen up after a bit of use. Everything about this watch screams quality and the design is so unique. People are bound to comment on it once I give this to him for him to wear. Overall, I love this watch, and I really think it's made with excellent quality and will last a while. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review and opinion., The face of this watch is rather large. I returned it and choose one with a smaller face., Didn't like it at all. Very cheap made stones was glued uneven and upside-down. Return it. It was completely my fault tho. ...MK for 20$ you wish, Pretty great watch and cool design just has that cheap product smell, go horns, Yes I like this watch, I gave it to my wife as a gift because she want it, It's lit, This looks to be a very well made and attractive watch, but both watches I received have had defective movements. The first watch, I noticed that watch would loose 5 mins for every 30 minutes. So, I requested a replacement. The replacement watch did work out of that box so I took it to a jeweler who could test the battery and the battery was fine. This means it was another defective movement. At this point, I requested a refund. Very disappointing., I work for an utility company and my job consist in being outdoors a lot. This watch is perfect for me. Very comfortable and not cheaply made., Awesome, like I wished for., Elegant, Love the look. Pretty lightweight. As the other reviews state, it is hard to see the digital parts at night., This is my fourth Timex Ironman watch.  That might sound bad, but when you consider that I purchased my first as a Peace Corps volunteer almost 20 years ago, that's pretty awesome!  I love the style, that they are rugged a take a beating (from trekking from the bottom of South America all the way through Central America and Mexico, numerous scuba trips, endless beach outings, two children and everything in between!), and that the newer versions come in nicer color and a slimmer design than previously.  Easy to program and use all of the features from the timer (so I don't burn the meatloaf), to the chronograph (for my son's lap times), to the multiple alarms. My favorite feature has always been the waterproof design...as a avid beach bum, snorkeler and previous scuba diver, these watches take a beating and last for years.<br /><br />I finally migrated from my basic black to this pretty gray and teal face...it's a nice change. I prefer the plastic bands over the nylon...too much time in the water can make the nylon bands smell terrible.  This is a slightly larger watch for woman....not the super slim design sometimes seen with woman's Timex, but not as large as a man's version.  I am very happy with this purchase!, The watch just broke on its on! I purchased this watch April 2015 and today the number 1 letter came out of the watch and it dangling. This watch is only used on special occasion so it hasn't even bee used more than 3 times. I like an exchange or a refund., Had this watch for 2 weeks. already has a chip on the crystal and condensation is under it. I work a relatively low-impact job, so this is severely upsetting.  Had it replaced once already. After not even 3 weeks of -moderate- work, another chip in another spot. New crystal, chipped again. Cheap crystal, my assumption. Not even bothering sending back. Do not recommend., The strap is very good looking but once I tried it on one part of the strap broke already..., Dope watch very durable!, The watch looks very good and it feels solid but I am disappointed with the calibration.  After one month, the dial for the day of the week was significantly off.  The minute dial also had a problem. It was too late to return to Amazon,so I had to send it in to Casio and they temporarily fixed it.  Casio did respond quickly I must say. Now after a year, it has happened again and it's out of warranty.  It is also complicated to set the time.  Read the instructions carefully. I also have a G-shock with atomic time keeping and the atomic part stopped working a year after I bought it. I think I will just sell the watch and buy another brand.  I am not happy with Casio., Amazing. Big, heavy, elegant. I love it., Looks good (not cheap) and holds up well. Wear it almost every day and to the hospital. Like it very much., This watch is everything I needed it to be and more. I am very happy with my choice.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I had to resize the bracelet myself or have it done because it was shipped too big. I just was frustrated a bit because I couldn't wear it right out of the box., You just know when you see these style of kits, you are not getting the best set of tools ever made.  I had to add links to a citizen watch, and I used this tool set to do it.  I'm not sure I did the right thing with the right tools, but I got the job done.  Inserting the link pins back in was very difficult to do with a tapered watch band.  At once point, I had to have my wife hold the band on it's side in the block so I could drive the pin back in.  I couldn't have done the job with out this kit though, so it's worth the money., This watch is way see than I thought it would be, if your a guy like me, trust me you should save your money and buy something else, it's like a ladies watch. Other than that though it's pretty nice, I would be satisfied with this watch if it was bigger., I need a watch like a hole in the head.  But, while shopping at Mystic Seaport in Connecticut, this store had a case of dw watches<br />and I was struck as to how beautiful they were, so I bought one, not realizing that they were on sale on Amazon for half the price that I paid. The staff were wearing dw watches which looked great on them.  Anyway, I love the watch and am glad that I bought it.<br /><br />Robert States, COOL, a really sharp looking watch that seems to keep time well. I've only had the watch a couple of days so it remains to be seen how well the watch will hold up, but over all I'm very satisfied with my purchase. the leather seems to be of high quality and is very comfortable on my wrist. The watch is also much lighter than i thought it would be. the one thing taking away from the watch is that i found the instructions could have been more clear, it seems they tried to keep their instructions short and simple but i believe a little more information would have made setting my watch up just a little easier. i purchased my watch on a lightening deal, so i didn't pay full price., Terrible watch...moisture got in it first time in the water., COOL, Crystal fell out., COOL, Fits great!  The product seems to be good quality.  I like the color.  It is easy to understand.  I received this at a discount for an honest review., Battery  was dead upon receiving  thia product. NOT a deal for me, gorgeous watch. get many compliments. just the right size. wish it was automatic., I don't know yet if this watch should to do. I E radio control,  as the book say's the signal from Fort Collins Co.is only good for 600 miles and i live over 1,000 away, also i do not live close to any of city's listed where i will be using the watch., Cheap and doesn't look like it. Got compliments on it. albeit from kids but hey it still counts., Substandard.  Not the same as the picture., Perfect  the only winder I would trust my watches too..., It's not the easiest watch to fix the time or date., This is a beautiful, well made watch., The rate is for how it looks, its not been used yet because it will be a gift for christmas, LOVE IT! Just came yesterday! I ordered it for my husbands anniversary present! It is a beautiful watch, big too! Comes in a nice box also!, I get compliments about this watch whenever I wear it; I also get comments about its size. While it can be a bit heavy at first, the feeling goes away quickly (even for a somewhat smaller guy like myself) and is a joy to look at and wear. If you can handle the size and weight, it's a beauty that's sure to catch people's attention., COOL, This looked nice but fell apart within a month. It was a gift that was picked out by the receiver., Good price, easy to read. Band seemed a little stiff at first, but got flexible after a few times wearing it., watch band too small, This watch is perfect for what I bought it for. I needed a watch with a second hand for nursing school. I like this watch - it's cute, white (so it matches no matter what color I wear and any dirt on it can be easily seen), it's a plastic material (to be easily cleaned), good quality, water-resistant, great price (I paid $18.75), durable (I have worn it 3x/week for about 6 months) and doesn't look cheap. I have not experienced any yellowing of the band or any cons that I can think of. The face of the watch is on the smaller side - but I would rather this versus too large of a face that makes it look gaudy. I haven't experienced any problems with comfortability or fit. Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase and wouldn't hesitate to buy again., Very solid made watch., LOVE! It's such a pretty and classy watch.  I took it to a Michael Kors store to get a sized for free.  Thank you to the people that posted pictures of this watch. This is why I ultimately decided to purchase it., This watch is beautiful ...elegant and delicate ...and I'm so glad found it at such amazing price at Amazon ...also very fast delivery ..:) highly recommended A+++, This is a very fancy watch for your significant other, or even someone close to you. The price of the watch is crazy high, but MyHabit has it for a great deal for you. Its all leather, thick top clear piece on  top. Handles rain, and showering just fine. Fits about any wrist, except any huge wrists like my husbands. The band is leather, and fits comfortably on your wrist day and night. The front clock has some really neat features. Then the back has a cool looking spinning mechanism on it. Takes a small watch battery but they last forever anyways. This watch does cost a lot, but totally worth it to anyone who loves wearing watches, especially ones that are in detail. This is a Heritor brand company, which is a great brand and very popular., It has military time, the date of the month, & color coded. The only problem is that it is very small, like a children's watch. But I have a skinny wrist so it's fine but still somewhat hard to see., Awesome purchase, This is my new favorite watch--beautiful (I keep staring at it throughout the day), lightweight, very legible and accurate.  I have 10 other watches that I no longer wear., I would love to have another one of these watches. It is sleek and attractive. I would often get compliments on it. At the time I got it on sale for $70. Unfortunately it stopped working after about 2 years. I thought it was the battery and took it to get replaced and was told that it had a mechanical issue. I took it to a watch maker and was told it would cost over $100 to fix. I do love this watch, no denying that, but I wish that it was just a little more durable., Worked well., The Only Ironman watch to have.  The only one with a durable stainless bracelet, where the link pins can't rip through the rubber spacers like the other Timex ironman model with the metal bracelet setup.  It has the excellent hi-vis Indiglow night display when sitting in the duck blind or deer stand.  I have had other models of the Ironman watch, and they all have warts.  Dead grass in the Velcro, having to fumble with a belt like buckle, metal bracelet watch band that rip apart on one snag of the watch on a anything because every other link on the band is rubber..  This model is the best, and also out of production by timex.  It is the only true Ironman watch they have made., I have had this little guy for 2 years and it's still going strong! I never take it off. It goes in the shower on a daily basis, was in a swimming pool for two lifeguard seasons, has withstood hiking, rockclimbing, basketball, travel, concerts etc...and switching timezones has never been easier (or more fun).<br />I superglued the pins in place after one broke within the first two months...do that and this thing will definitely outlive the money you spend on it! Looks great too!, This is an excellent watch, and arrived on time., EVERYONE THINKS IT IS THE ROLEX THAT I HAD TO SELL!!!, Black case was &#34;shiney black&#34; not matte...did not look good., Very pretty, Perfect!!!, AWESOME, Purchased for my son's bd less than 8 weeks ago and the minute hand is already broken.  Of course it is not eligible for return, so we have to send a check and the watch to the manufacture.  He loves the watch too, but I cannot say I will buy this product again., I'll have to admit I'm a tad disappointed but the whole &#34;Platinum Ice&#34; thing compensates for most of that.<br />You see I was on Shnoop and bought an Accutron that usually lists at $700.00 for $120 and it only loses 2 seconds in 6 months.  Then I bought another Shnoopie for $100 that usually lists for $650 and it only gains 3 seconds in 6 months.<br />I was hoping at this price it would be accurate to a couple of nanoseconds a decade but it's less accurate than either of the Accutron Shnoopies.<br />Oh well, live and learn I guess, while I wouldn't say the blue is really &#34;blue&#34; at least the ceramic really is ceramic., Stylish, with pretty good fit. I would actually prefer that it have one more link, but that's a minor concern. I like how well it goes with my watch, and it's much better than the OEM band that came with the watch., typical timex. Good value for your money, Tested down to 27ft. I work in an aquarium so it is constantly exposed to salt and harsh conditions. It has weathered several drops and bad bangs on doors and countertops without damaging the watch. I LOVE the indiglo function for dimly lit conditions inside the building and in the water., If you have a thin wrist it will fit, but it is very tight on an average size wrist. Also the crown is very small and difficult to turn with adult fingers. The box it comes in is pretty crummy as well. They have stopped using watch boxes and it came on a plastic spindle with no box at all. It does keep accurate time and is very light to wear, just hope it lasts for a while., Amazing timepiece its very beautiful in person and I never regretted buying this lovely timepiece. The only downside is that its not solar drive buh all in all its still a very nice watch., VERY BEAUTIFUL!! MY GIRLFRIEND  HAPPY!, Pretty, This watch is only design. That it.<br />It  isn't working  good some function a few months later.  Even  NO warranty<br /><br />I asked them  warranty  .<br />how can i contact the manufacturer (Haurex)?<br /><br />They said. ......  INTERNET.<br /><br />Only the word answer.<br /><br />Bad service.  Bad attitude.  Bad warranty., This watch is very pretty but it's very hard to work and understand., Thank You, This pocket watch is very nice and stylish.  It was received quickly and in good condition - well packaged.  Very happy with this purchase., It looks better in pictures. Quality is poor. You may use it just for looking the time, don't expect anything more. I thought it was big but turned out it wa-s a small watch., This is a very nice watch, especially for the price.  It is nicely packaged and the automatic winder is a very good idea.  However, I found that the dial was difficult for me to read.  In my opinion, Swiss Legend needs to design in more contrast between the hands, dial face, and numerals.  I buy larger watches mainly because they are easier to read and I find this lack of clearness a big drawback for me.  For others with better eyesight than mine this may not be such an important matter.  I am returning this watch but I would not hesitate to recommend it to those who can see a little better than I do., I bought seven of these for every day of the week. Worst decision of my life!!!! The front is horrendous. All of the strippers at the clubs i own in Miami said it looks like an old mans watch from target. I decided to donate it to charity because they would need it more than me. also the batteries came dead., Awesome piece of workmanship, First of all I want to say this is a beautiful watch.  It gets noticed and I want to love it.  The band's reptilian &#34;scales&#34; look great.  It's heavy, but gorgeous.<br /><br />I have a couple of issues with this watch, one consequentia,l the other unignorable.<br /><br />I have an issue with the company's instruction manual which could have caused me to return the watch. The watch's operation is somewhat complicated in that you have to unscrew all buttons and crown to get them to work, yet the generic instructions don't mention this.  I was able to resolve this issue by watching a Youtube video reviewing the watch, but if this video wasn't available, I might have never figured out how it operates.<br /><br />I have another, this time deal-breaking issue with this watch.  It is supposed to be watertight down to 1000 meters.  I took it swimming in my 5' (1.7m) pool for less than 10 minutes and it has now developed a foggy crystal.  I had to return it for this reason.  Sigh...<br /><br />Like I said, I wanted to love it.<br /><br />Though I could try another one of this model, my confidence in Invicta is low right now.  I purchased another Invicta watch (at $1/3 the price of this one) along with this one, so I will reserve final judgment until I have had that one for awhile., I bought this for an 8 year old boy who loved it.  The watch was easy to set up and is working well., This is the third time I am buying one of these watch rolls.  First I bought the brown (coco) and blue one.  Both were identical quality and looked good.  Then I wanted to order a red one but decided last minute to buy this black version because it looked updated with a covered button.  Now I regret it because I found out that although the interior is similar to the two others, the exterior feels far less quality.  Even to a level that i doubt real leather was used for the outside of the roll.  So the function is still the same, the feeling is far less., This is a neat watch.  I really like the movement, and the &#34;open heart&#34; design.  I don't love the band, but it's still a very interesting watch, and I really like it., Was disappointed seemed too dark in color and felt cheaply made but will see how it holds up, Excellent watch. Feels, looks and function like any more expensive watch., I replaced a Casio F-108WH which died with this watch. It is much smaller and to read. It looks more a ladies watch., This is a beautiful watch. I like the large size many others complained about, however I have a large wrist so it feels good. I returned two other watches prior to this because they felt so tiny. The watches movements are quite, unlike one of the others I looked at. It drove me crazy during the day. This is great watch I plan to wear for years to come., Nice looking watch but the buttons around the crown are nonfunctional, they and the small dials are for looks only, attractive and easy to set and easy to read. I love it, Thnx, Great looking watch. Not so big that it looks cartoonish. Been loudly ticking away for over 2 weeks without losing a minute. One wind lasts more than 2 days. Only complaint would be that the band appears to be too wide.  It doesn't fit smoothly through the buckle and has to be forced through.  Its not a huge issue and definitely doesn't stop me from wearing it., You get what you pay for :), OKAY, I had been looking for a mechanical aviator style watch for some time when I came across this Orient Pilot. I have had this watch for over a year, and it has been incredibly accurate once regulated, running about +/- 2 seconds per day. At 42mm diameter with 22mm lugs, the quality of this watch compares favorably with the Hamilton Khaki at less than half the price. I wear this watch every day, and the case, crystal and black leather band are still flawless. If you are looking for a Military style automatic, then you can't go wrong with this watch., Very satisfied with this watch.The band takes a bit of getting used to but it holds together securely and I've decided to keep it as is for now. Aesthetically the watch is first rate, it is much more impressive in hand than the pictures suggest. The sweep second hand and the tuning fork logo are nicely done. Accuracy is outstanding so far., It's a pretty cool watch for the price.only had a few problems calabrateing it but it helped reading the manual. Takes about half an hour to have everything calibrated., People know me for my big watches, do this is great. Being older , I don't need my reading glasses for these. Thinking of purchasing s different color too., I gave 5 stars for the value and style of this invicta.. it's rated to 200 or 300 meters which is well beyond the capability of any casual diver or even pro for that matter.<br />My only disappointment is it does not seem to be as robust or built tank like, as compared to older models. I have an older quartz movement invicta that you just can't kill..had it over 15 yrs and still going strong.  Time will tell if this holds up as well.<br />But you can't go wrong for the price.  I recomended this watch, Excellent, very cheap looking...cant even figure out how to put on... don't anyone buy this watch..., Subpar, Got it a week ago, because I have a very scratchy stone desk where I work, and all my steel watches got really scratched up. This one still looks like new. I hope it holds up through time. Its a beautiful, comfortable, and practical watch. Update: I've owned this watch for a few months now, I love it even more. The band still looks brand new and is shiny. No scratches what so ever. Beautiful, light, and comfortable. I'm very happy with my purchase., I almost didn't buy this particular watch. I really liked some of the features this watch offered but I wanted the option of a light. I had purchased another Casio watch on Amazon  (Casio Illuminator LA-20WH purple/pink screen) that had a light, date displayed on the main screen, lightweight black band. Pretty much everything I was wanting in a digital watch. The light and date were very important to me. However, when I received it, I became very frustrated with how hard it was to use the buttons. Extremely difficult! By this point, I didn't care about the futures that I just had to have. I had to seriously squeeze the button to get the light to come on. My finger was raw! I decided to keep the watch because it would coast me more money to return it. With all of that said.... (I promise I'm getting to my review on this watch!)  I decided to go for this simple watch KNOWING it wouldn't have a light... Or the date displayed on the main screen.<br /><br />Here is why I love it!!!!  I specifically purchased this watch for the count down timer, the black band, and for it's small size. I read all of the reviews for it prior to buying the first watch and loved how everyone really liked the count down feature. Huge plus for me! I'm a stay at home Mom to four busy kids and I can not tell you how much I've used this feature already! Wow! When you click the top right button a little mark goes under each number. So if I want 15 minutes, click the button 5 times and a little bar blinks right below the number I selected. When I happen to glance down at the watch, I can see that the little bar has moved its way down to the last number- so I know that the timer is gonna go off soon! That's handy to be able to gauge the time. I'm not guessing, &#34;I wonder how long it's been?&#34; Very cool. The screen is the size of a dime. It's small, simple, very clean looking. I wanted a watch that didn't take up my entire wrist, and that was not heavy to wear. I seriously don't feel it at all.The band is so soft and extremely light. I personally do not think it looks cheap as others had mentioned. The pink boarder is like a bubble gum pink, very cute against the black! The numbers are very clear, I have no problems seeing the numbers whatsoever. And I can definitely hear the alarm when it goes off. No problem there- I have a very loud house too. Like other reviewers have said (and what I originally set out for in a watch), this would be the perfect watch if it had a light. I personally haven't mind. I really like all the features and the ease of the watch that the light really doesn't matter anymore. This watch is super simple, super easy to use, and the buttons do not hurt my fingers! One other thing that I absolutely LOVE is that I can push down the bottom right button and the month/date/day will appear. I had read a review that also gave this information and I was so glad they did because having the date was very important to me. Reading that review sold me! I needed this feature. Granted it's not on the main screen but I could live with that! One click, there's the date (8 26 WE)! Awesome! I love this watch you guys! It's a great price, pretty pink, very simple, great for small wrists, sporty look.... I hope this helps you in picking the right watch for you! I also couldn't go wrong with &#34;Free Returns&#34; so I thought why not try it?! Sooo glad I did! ;), OK, COOL, Great storage for any watch I take with me on trips. It's large enough to hold my larger watches without any problems., I received the watch about a week ago, and I've been wearing it everyday. Love the look. Unfortunately it seems the watch would stop or suddenly slows way down every couple of days. A couple of days (day 3 after receiving it) into wearing it, I noticed it was hours behind, but running, when I looked to check the time. Trying to be optimistic I just thought it was because it hadn't been wound enough. I simply adjusted the time and went on with my day. I was checking it through out the day and the next day, and it was running flawlessly. The following day (day 5), I noticed it was again several hours behind! Still trying to be optimistic, I thought I would give it a couple more days thinking it just needed some &#34;breaking-in&#34; as with a lot of mechanical devices. This morning, I noticed it was exactly 2 hours behind! This is the first self-winding automatic watch I've owned. I've read that if the watch movements were magnetized somehow it would affect the accuracy among other things. I hope the problem corrects itself soon. If not, I'll exchange it. I really like the look and the price, so hopefully it works out.  Update: I'm sending it back for a different one. In roughly 5 hours it slowed by almost an entire hour! From reading some of the other review it seems Seiko's quality control and/or the Malaysian movement is not exactly top notch, at least on this line. It's very much hit or miss. I hope the next one I receive doesn't turn out to be another dud.  Update 10/5/15: Receive replacement from Amazon a little over a month ago. This one seems to be a keeper! I've been wearing the replacement almost every day since receiving it, and it's been very accurate. Even when I skipped wearing it for a day it was able to keep accurate time. Again, I love the look and the military green color, but I'm still weary of Seiko's quality control on the movement based on personal experience and other reviews posted here. I realize it's not Japanese movement, and that's one of the reason why it's priced quite low, but I did expect better from a company like Seiko.  Overall if you don't mind maybe having to exchange the watch once (or twice) until you get one that works properly (and you may well get one the first time) it's a good deal for a self-winding automatic., I had one that was looking a bit bad after 5 years of daily use, this was like getting it brand new again for a fraction of what I originally paid $300, Purchased this for my son, a high school junior.  He had a previous version which he used all last year for ROTC to time himself on PT, and through the summer as a lifeguard.  (Being waterproof and having a timer and an alarm are a necessity for him.)  We purchased this version when he lost his old watch because he felt lost without it.<br /><br />Best features:<br />Easy to program<br />Indiglo for nighttime and underwater<br />Simple to set and use timer, alarm and chronograph features<br />Waterproof features<br />Durable and comfortable<br /><br />Great value for the money, Amazing Watch, I returned this watch right after I opened it.  The watch looked more like a lady's watch as the size of the watch is too small for my taste.  I should probably have paid attention to the dimensions and compare to my current watches before purchasing., I love my new invicta watch invicta watches are the best most fashioned watches around an you can't beat the price especially on Amazon. Com....its almost timebto buy another one...lol, Excellent. Holds charge well  and  does a lot, The traditional look and feel of the watch are terrific. So far, so good.  I have an older Stuhrling watch, about,10 years old, that runs better than my Rolex watch., The battery was dead when I received the watch. I had to take it to a jewelry store to have a new one put in., Needed a gold watch to go with my rings. This watch did the trick perfectly. A beautiful and masculine piece that exceeded my expectations! Looks like a million bucks, more beautiful and impressive than the pictures. Very pleased!!!, They are perfect for our seven-year-old and five-year-old children. They have every feature they could possibly want and are more than happy to use them., This Swiss Legend Men's 10020-014-GRYS Highlander Analog Display Swiss Quartz Grey Watch is huge! Fortunately, I am a fairly big guy and it fits me very well.<br /><br />The watch is a left-hand model, made to worn on the right wrist with the controls accessed by the left hand. Fortunately, again, I am left-handed. This has the standard time and date features you would expect but also has a very useful 30-minute count down timer.<br /><br />This is a great looking, if large, watch that would make a great gift for a larger left-handed man.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH, This is an absolutely beautiful watch. It's solid, never needs batteries, and looks so nice on! I love the dark blue face too. It's looks navy blue in outdoor light, and looks very dark, almost black, in artificial indoor light. But even indoors, if there are windows with sunlight coming in, it will still look beautiful deep navy blue. Unique and very pretty contrast to the shiny silver and gold! Also .... I love that it has both the day of the week and date on the face, as well as luminous hands to see in the dark. It is everything that I was looking for! I uploaded some pics so you can get a better idea of the actual color of the face, as well as what it looks like in the dark., Looks better than expected! i might purchase another soon, A great first watch. The band fits beautifully and the numbers on the face are easy for a toddler to read., Overall very nice watch. Lite in weight - not clunky at all. Fits and wears comfortably on wrist, easy to read especially at night with large luminous numbers.  Date is a bit hard to set but once in place works fine.  Quality leather band., Paired with a Seiko SNZG15J1 perfectly., I really like this watch because you can see actual number for all the hours not dots or marks. I wear it most of the time., No bad, good casio replacement., Amazing!, COOL, Initially you did not send installation instructions. I was instructed by you to obtain them from Timex. Unfortunately, these instructions indicate the requirement of a special tool. Consequently, I am in the process of returning the band and I am abandoning use of the Timex., I love Timex Ironman watches.  I have never been disappointed until I got this one.  I got this one 3 days ago and I am returning it due to the face that the face is starting to &#34;peel&#34; off at the bottom.  It looks like a cheap sticker on it.  I will buy another Timex just not this style with the way the face is put together., simple and cheap, This was a gift for my 24 yr. old grandson who scuba dives.  The price was unbelievable....wish we had bought two.  He is very pleased with it.  Recommend!, I love this clock. Great features make it easy to use., Very happy with the product., to small but cute., All the features you would expect from an analog-digital G-Shock, but in a smaller package than you would anticipate. Although the specs say 47mm, and measuring at the widest point gets you that number, this wears MUCH smaller than a typical 47mm watch. As is typical of most G-Shocks, much of that width is taken up by the shock-absorbing bezel, and the face is small compared to the diameter of the case. With the metal construction, this model wears even smaller than that, though. The way the bracelet attaches to the lugs allows it fit more snugly around your wrist, and the links are fairly narrow on the back side. The combination of those factors make the watch seem much more moderately sized than the raw numbers would suggest. The bracelet does use solid pins with tiny inserts, so you may want to get this sized by a professional unless you're really comfortable doing it yourself., Beautiful. I have put it my white Skagen watch.  It is well constructed and looks really sharp., Excellent product, Best watch I ever owned, lots compliments, My husband initially loved the look of this watch. Very masculine design, with a huge display, making it very easy to read the time. Functions well, but after playing with it for awhile, it just seems cheaply made. It's also obviously made for a left-hander, which wasn't made clear until it was on his wrist. It's not a big problem, but it would have been nice to know., I love this watch and bracelet combo.It looks cute on and has two different snaps so you can adjust it to fit your wrist. This would make a great gift! I received mine at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I would have bought this even without the discount, this is such a cute piece oj jewelry! I highly recommend it!!, very practical.  My partner works with horses and likes that he can wear this at the stables without worry.  Durable and has all the necessary features., Excelent product, This Casio is performant and nice to have if you want to see the time date and to wakeup in the morning by the alarm when you go to work., Love my watch! My wrist is small, but it fits fine!!, Excellent Wacth!!!, After purchasing several Invicta watches I was quite surprised this watch was so thin. Anyone owning an Invicta watch will be disappointed with this model.  I have small wrists and this watch does not stand out.  Beautiful design but did not meet my expectation.  I would love to have a heavier watch., Twenty years ago I bought a Seiko watch very similar to this watch, except it required a battery.  Recently it's been acting up, which is the reason that I bought this SSC141 watch.  The latter is slightly larger.  It looks good and cost less than half of what I paid for my old Seiko.  I have no complaints about the small second hand.  The large stop watch needle is good.  Hope that this watch lasts as long as my  old watch.  As for the  band, I shortened the links by two on each side.  All I used was a large safety pin (point cut off) and a needle nose plier.  Push the pins out (arrow direction) and pull the pins out with the plier.  Reverse the process to put it back.  Knowing how much to remove is the most difficult part.  This process should take about 15 to 20 minutes.  No need any special tools or gadgets. I was going to buy a Citizen eco-drive watch but this Seiko costed less and, I think has a harder crystal.  Hope this helps., oor quality, I like the simplicity of this watch that just tells the time, with a large, very readable face. It keeps very accurate time. It's pretty, too, the leather band is nice and feels like it will hold up to wear and tear. The blue color of the band looks just the same as it did on my monitor, so the color is exactly what I expected and like. The packaging said this watch's movement was made in the Philippines and the strap in India, for those who wish to have countries of origin info., This strap is tight, I love it, I did trim mine a little bit then sealed it by applying heat to the end with a lighter. It absorbs water and stays wet for a while so washing hands can get a little annoying if you just want a full waterproof watch, and it will smell weird after a while if you're active with this strap, so that's the downside. I lost my watch with this strap but I would've imagined I'd have to go to an extreme measure to get rid of the funky built up smell. Don't get it wet I guess. Besides that it looked tight and it was very secure, I was confident of my watch staying in place (part of the reason I replaced my old strap)., Came thru with a chip on the crystal. Never bothered to return it., This is a very sweet little watch, and is definitely worth the low price. My one remark is that the band seems unusually short. I have small wrists, and I have to use the 4th out of 7 holes to buckle it comfortably. I usually use the smallest or next to smallest option on watches. This would likely not fit someone with large wrists because the band is not long enough. Otherwise I love the rose gold color with the grey band. Plus the silver face makes it able to be warn with silver jewelry., But too small for my wrist, really sized for a woman's wrist., good morning I need to validate the tracking number that purchased the 28de January of this year, Gorgeous! I ordered the Invicta Gold & Black Pro Diver watch for my husband as a anniversary gift.  My husband was thrilled when he opened the box. The watch looks great in person, than it does online.  It's a great gift for the man in your life. I'm going to order a Invicta watch for myself as well., Plastic that holds the band on broke after three months since it is past the 30 day return can't do much about it very disappointing!!, Bought for $299, which was too much.  Chronograph did not function properly.  The one time I attempted to use the chronograph, the second hand failed to reline properly. Every time I used the chronograph the second hand would line up in random places, never at the 12 spot.  The buttons did not work on first push.  The watch dial was not very distinct.  I have a $175 Seiko and a $300 Citizen which are far better.  At the time I got the GV2, my wife got a Victorniox, which is far better.  I returned the watch after two weeks.  I would not recommend this watch., DO NOT BUY!!! Horrible-no instructions included and impossible to figure out how to set, I've been an electronic technician for 35+ years and I could not get this watch to work with my Samsung Note II.  Sent it back and exchanged it for a Pebble Time that I'm most happy with.., The alarm is weak, the numbers are difficult to see in the dark! Tried this for two days and it is a no go for me, My husband was very happy with his new Invicta., Similar to the original strap...but a little different., Clockwork Synergy is an awesome company with fabulous customer service.  Although I ordered the wrong width for two watch straps, Natalie in customer service went above and beyond what is usually expected.  She made it a personal mission to make sure I received what I had in mind originally.  The replacement order came in record time and the exchange was easy.  AND, the watch straps are of great quality and stylish.  Thank you!, its now my favorite watch!!!, Awesome and accurate also amazon is great with shipping and prices love it and thank u, Great watch...the poor man's Rolex Daytona.  Like that it's automatic rather than manual wind like the early Speedmaster.  The band is not easy to adjust, had to take it to a jeweler...the rolex band is better for fine adjustments...this is either too loose, or too tight.  Otherwise...GREAT WATCH!!!!, I was worried about this watch for being a &#34;cheap watch&#34; Not at all! This is my everyday casual watch, and it is sturdy, amazing craftsmenship! The leather is wonderful, it molded in easily. The watch itself is fairly thin, with a perfect diameter! I love the watch!, Love this watch.  Fashion forward.  Nice leather band.  Easy to read face., I could not get the battery to sit properly in its holder. At one point I got it running, but then took it down to reposition it, and the battery jostled out of place again so that it did not chime. I could have worked with it more, but I bought it for the chime, and it's a loud chime anyway, that I felt wouldn't work in the kitchen where I needed it. Not a bad chime, but really ringing, so many people might like it very much. I returned mine., makes taking out watch links simple & easy.<br />definitely helps saves me $$$ from having to take it to a watch shop!, Does not fit all, So pleased with this product!!! It looks exactly like the picture and is really sturdy!<br />I love it!<br />the only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because the shipping took a while and I'm very impatient but other than that I definitely recommend!, I was disappointed.  The numbers are silver, not white, and were hard to read in some light conditions (near invisible at times).  Planning to send it back., Absolutely love this watch! Great face size, comfortable fit, and simple enough to wear with so much!, Contrary to good taste, I like the ticking sound. I don't find it to be audible beyond a pretty quiet room, but then I had my amps turned up way too high in high school.<br /><br />Looks good, easy to glance at, easy to set. Money well spent., not too bad, leaks like a siv though.  tends to jump dates and hours as your wrist will hit the buttons on the watch frequently., Everything was ok. I received the watch and it is working fine. It is absolutly silent. Thanks to the company for the concern. But the delay was because of the Mail Office in Uruguay., Work just fine. Saved me a trip to the watchmaker., Had a very large bracelet  that was impossible  to  adjust.  Beautiful  otherwise, just can't  wear it., Broken after two weeks., Light weight feeling on the wrist.Keeps time accurately.I find the juxtaposition of the Roman numerals and classic design with solar technology appealing., Gorgeous watch. Looks much more expensive than it is. 40 bucks and free shipping is a no - brainer. Sign me up, I'm in....., this watch  looks beautiful with vrry good details  the orange face really shines and on your wrist it looks like you are wearing a 500 dollar watch, It functioned normally for 2 years and died. I figured the battery had finished and I took for technical assistance to replace it. At that time I discovered that there was a problem with the clock and they charged me the value of the clock to repair. I did not do the repair and of course I will not buy any other Tissot., Comfortable, soft rubber. A little short if you have a large wrist., I got this watch on a &#34;deal&#34;from Amazon. I wanted a watch with Roman numerals and this looked like something I wanted to wear. It keeps the time accurately and looks good on my wrist. The only negative for me is the watch face is bigger than I expected it to be based on the photo. Other than that, I like the watch., Very lite and easy to read, Metal parts on the watch are rusted., This model ProTrek  is the latest and in my opinion the best version so far. Before purchasing you should ask yourself which of the model S3500-1JF types do you like. Choices include a silver outside ring with a normal display, a black outside ring with a negative (darker face) or this type... a black ring with the normal display. All three are the same basic watch but I prefer this particular type over the other two. I do own the silver ring model as well. The silver ring with normal display model usually runs about 100 dollars cheaper but for me this black with green accents version looks the best and the easiest to read The negative display version is just too hard to read for most people. The S3500-1JF has large, easy to push function buttons, larger number displays and more accurate readings for the altimeter, barometer and compass. The band is carbon fiber which from my understanding is more durable than the classic resin band on the US models. The watch also has sunrise and sunset times as opposed to other types that have tide and moon information. I find the sunset and sunrise information is more useful but you will need to research and determine your longitude and latitude so your can enter that information to make the sunrise/sunset times more accurate. The casing size is larger than most Casio watches but not unsightly odd. It looks great and sits very comfortably on my wrist. This watch is highly recommended and that comes from a guy that has many different types and models of G Shocks and A-B-C watches (ProTrek/ Pathfinder). This particular seller delivered fast and everything was packed well., super, I love the design of this watch. Really happy with the purchase. I didn't find instructions, but setting the watch is fairly simple. To change the date, pull the pin out to the half position (or first click) and turn counter-clockwise (this is the system for most watches). Also, it took me a second to realize you're supposed to put your hand through the inner loop before putting the band through the clasp. I hope this helps., Beautiful watch, This watch is very advanced and the initial set-up takes a few minutes to get everything dialed in just the way you want. However, once it's set, everything seems so simple. I'm able to have the larger numbers show me local time while smaller numbers show me Zulu time., The watch works perfectly & it is the genuine article!  It did arrive dead & I had to seek out a local watch maker to replace the battery, but the co play reimbursed me the cost of the replacement battery. ...just a bit of a hassel., It's perfect, I like it, This watch is beautiful and very comfortable to wear. Plus it's a very casual watch that looks great. Hour and minute hands also glow it the dark., This is an expensive, but very well-made watch band.  It definitely has a break-in period and it was somewhat uncomfortable the first couple of times that I wore it.  However, after about the third time on, it had started to mold to my wrist and has been comfortable ever since.  The kevlar is hard and not very flexible, but the leather on the inside is soft. The kevlar feels so tough, that I've joked that it feels like it could stop a bullet...not that I ever hope to be in need of that!<br /><br />Overall, the band is attractive and the stitching is done well. I put it on a Swiss Army/Victorinox Alpnach Chronograph and it looks awesome!<br /><br />I'm only knocking it a star because of the break-in period.  Other than that, it's a great watch band., Completely satisfied, Love this watch! It is big but not too big. It is very comfortable to wear and does not slide all around. The aqua face is so pretty and goes with a lot of colors in my wardrobe. Very happy with this watch., Swiss Legend makes excellent watches (I know because I purchased one for myself last year) and this watch is no exception.  As others have mentioned, it is a heavier watch made of stainless steel, but it looks great for someone who can wear it.<br /><br />You can swim with the watch, but not dive with it.  I have used mine while swimming and had no problem with it.  This watch also has a dependable clasp to keep it on your wrist.  I like the black face of the watch as well.  Most important of all, it does keep perfect time.<br /><br />Don't be intimidated by the dials - you can use them or leave them alone.  In my opinion, no one should downgrade a watch because they can't figure out how it works.  They all work if you take the time to learn about each feature.<br /><br />Highly recommended brand and watch.  Enjoy!, Excellent, Wicked cheap and really small.  Looks more like a woman's or children's watch.  Other then that, it's a watch, and it tells time., This sports  watch is so classic and unique! Goes with all sports attire!, The watch is neat looking and cool to my 13 year old. The problem is it isn't very functional. It is hard to read and hard to set up. Since it is all dots just doesnt make it practical. It also stopped working within a few months completely., Pretty! I was hoping the strap will be more than but it looks good! Hope my fiance loves it!, Excellent, thin profile watch. I bought this as an upgrade to the exact same watch in white color, and am very pleased. My old classic G-shock has never left my wrist and I have put it through pure hell. I expect the same from this watch and look forward to the atomic time features for traveling. If you have small wrists, want a thin profile watch that wont snag on things, looks good in work or dress, is totally shock or waterproof, works in freezing weather, takes a beating, solar capable and never needs a battery...then look no further. Living in the mountains, I would never pick anything different. The classic G Shock line in is the way to go!, Large and easy to read, with second hand.  Only drawback is that the dial is not lighted.  Comfortable, with nice leather band., Exactly what I expected, nailed it , useful for LG G watch\n",

Could not have been more pleased. A great addition to my collection., great looking sports watch, A great automatic, but I give it 4 stars for being too conservative with its small size and the blue is dark and more of a navy color unless light is shining on it and reflecting. Other than that, like all based seiko 5s, it looks great on a Nato strap. I have this bad boy setup on a brown leather strap with a deployable clasp which looks very similar to the Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra.

Watch looks new, Great item....beautiful! Thank you!, Great product! Fast delivery!! Thanks, The watch is a great looking watch... but it HUGE ! (see pictures)  Perhaps I have a small wrist, but this thing spans almost the width of my wrist.  Also, as you can see by the pictures, I have changed the band.  The leather band that comes with it is nice, but here again, it's huge also.  The tongue (the part that hangs out past the buckle part), hung out so far it was annoying because it caught on everything. Here again, perhaps my wrist is small, but this strap was much larger than any other watch I have purchased.  Again, I like the look of the watch, its a great looking watch, but I feel like a rapper with bling on when I wear it. The new band I bought ((Amazon)Hadley Roma MB3805Y) matches great, and I think adds to the great look of the watch, and its a much better fit also.  This will not be my daily go-to watch, but I'll wear it once in a while, as it's more of a conversation piece rather than an everyday wrist watch., Great quality as expected from Invicta.

It's big, but not too big. I love the face, and the multiple dials even though they don't work. Great color and contrast...The strap is a hard rubber but still very comfortable. I hope it stands up for awhile as its my &#34;go to&#34; black and gold dress watch now, for casual dress up. I recommend it because at that price point you can't go wrong!!!, This is a great watch for an active person. My daughter fell in love with it! It fits her slim wrist (she is ten), and it is water proof. Her eyes were able to read the direction (mine were not without my glasses....talk about small print!). It feels comfortable and she loves all of the options. It seems like it will hold up to an active child's routine, which is great. The color is exactly as pictured and looks almost liquid-like.

Great for working in a hospital., Excellent watch, great color combination and people often compliment me on it.<br /><br />Cons: The bezel around the watch as well as the watch band is glossy.
